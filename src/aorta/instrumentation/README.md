# aorta.instrumentation

Platform-level introspection for AORTA: the environment probe (issue #147), the
per-layer numerics logger, and the two GPU profiling collectors. Future
submodules (drift watcher, etc.) will live here too.

## What's here

| Submodule | Purpose | Public API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`environment`](environment.py) | ROCm + ML stack version snapshot + container/python env detection. See block list below. | `collect_env(...) -> EnvSnapshot`, `capture_to(path, ...) -> EnvSnapshot` |
| [`layer_numerics`](layer_numerics/README.md) | Per-layer / per-stage NaN, magnitude, and out-of-range logger. Runs standalone as a front-end around a training/repro script (the supported path); also a recognized `layer_numerics` sweep collector — the engine validates the name and threads it into workload config, but a workload must opt in for capture (see [`docs/layer-numerics.md`](../../../docs/layer-numerics.md)). Config via `NANLOG_SPEC` (structured, recommended) or the flat `NANLOG_*` vars. | `build_env(results_dir, overrides=None) -> dict`, `SCRIPT_PATH`, `OUTPUT_SUBDIR` |
| [`rocprof`](rocprof/__init__.py) | `rocprofv3` kernel/API tracing as the `rocprof` sweep collector. Unlike `layer_numerics` it needs no workload opt-in: it attaches by wrapping the launch argv in the generic subprocess seam, so `aorta sweep run --collect rocprof -- <any command>` profiles an opaque command. Options validated at recipe load; artifacts parsed fail-soft into `rocprof_*` trial metrics. See [`docs/profiling-collectors.md`](../../../docs/profiling-collectors.md). | `wrap_argv(argv, out_dir, options, *, env=None) -> list[str]`, `build_argv_prefix(...)`, `parse_summary(out_dir) -> dict`, `validate_options(...)`, `resolve_binary()`, `OUTPUT_SUBDIR` |
| [`proton`](proton/__init__.py) | Triton Proton profiler as the `proton` sweep collector, attributing GPU time to the launching Python frame. Same argv seam, but Proton's front-end `exec`s a script, so `mode: cli` attaches to Python launches only and `mode: env` exports `AORTA_PROTON_*` for a workload that drives Proton itself. Translates `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES` on AMD. See [`docs/profiling-collectors.md`](../../../docs/profiling-collectors.md). | `wrap_argv(argv, out_dir, options, *, env=None) -> list[str]`, `build_argv_prefix(...)`, `build_env(out_dir, options) -> dict`, `parse_summary(out_dir) -> dict`, `validate_options(...)`, `OUTPUT_SUBDIR` |
| [`rocjitsu_sanitizers`](rocjitsu_sanitizers/README.md) | Experimental typed kernel worklists, deterministic top-N selection, exact-entry static Waitcheck, fail-closed Record/Replay parsing, versioned sanitizer reports, and `mode: sanitizer` recipe execution via `aorta sweep run`. Provisioning and scoped/top-K ConSan remain explicit follow-ups; ConSan never falls back to whole-application instrumentation. | `select_kernels(...)`, `run_waitcheck(...)`, `run_sanitizers(...)`, `execute_sanitizer_run(...)`, `SanitizerReport` |
| [`build_system`](build_system.py) | Detects Buck2 build environments (issue #163, A1.2a). Wrapped by `collect_env()` and surfaced as the `build_system` field of `EnvSnapshot`. | `detect_build_system() -> dict` |
| [`buck_invocation`](buck_invocation.py) | Frozen, ordered Buck invocation context: mode/flag files, `-c` overrides, `-m` modifiers, or explicit default confirmation. Builds atomic argv and a redacted comparison fingerprint; no shell/passthrough string. | `BuckInvocationContext` |
| [`buck_introspect`](buck_introspect.py) | Buck-aware library introspection via bound `buck2 cquery 'deps(%s)' <target> --json` (issue #163, A1.2b; context provenance schema 1.13). Triggered by `collect_env(buck_target=...)`; populates `buck_invocation`, `library_introspection`, and `library_introspection_alternates`. | `introspect_libraries_via_buck(...) -> BuckIntrospectionResult` |
| [`recipes/buck`](recipes/buck.py) | BUCK file-fragment emitter for `aorta env recipe --format buck` (issue #163, A1.2c). Reads `build_system` + `library_introspection` from a captured env.json dict and emits one `prebuilt_cxx_library` per `source == "buck"` entry, prefixed with a loud "BEST-EFFORT, NOT EXACT" header. Pure text generation -- never invokes `buck2 build`, never vendors Buck rules. | `emit_buck_recipe(env: dict) -> str` |

**`environment` blocks** (every snapshot includes all of these; missing
values become `None` plus a `partial_reasons` line):

* System: `rdhc` health snapshot, ROCm version files, HIP toolchain,
  container/python env detection, canonical env-var capture.
* GEMM/kernel libraries: `hipBLASLt`, `rocBLAS`, `MIOpen` (conv
  kernels), `RCCL` (collectives), `Composable Kernel` (with both
  `system` and `pytorch_bundled` sub-blocks), `Tensile` (cross-library
  kernel-DB fingerprint).
* GPU + host: `gpu_arch` (gfx-target distribution via
  `rocm_agent_enumerator`), `host` (kernel + glibc + machine arch).
* PyTorch ecosystem: `Triton`, `FBGEMM` (pip + PyTorch build flags),
  `AITER`, `AOTriton` (default ROCm Flash Attention backend; bundled
  in `<torch>/lib/libaotriton_v2.so*` via cmake-fetched dep, not a
  submodule), `pytorch_version`, `pytorch_build` (structured:
  git_commit from `torch.version.git_version` + per-submodule SHAs
  from `git -C <src>/third_party/<sub> rev-parse HEAD` when
  `AORTA_PYTORCH_SRC` points at a source tree, otherwise GitHub URL
  template for manual lookup).
* Build system: `build_system` (always present; `{"kind": "buck2",
  ...}` when Buck2 is on PATH and functional, `{"kind": "none"}`
  otherwise). Populated by `aorta.instrumentation.build_system.detect_build_system()`.
* Buck invocation: `buck_invocation` (always present), which records the
  redacted client-side cquery context and configured root target. It does not
  report actual execution placement or resolve execution-context Q1/Q2.
* Library introspection (Buck mode only): `library_introspection` and
  `library_introspection_alternates` (always present; both `[]`
  outside Buck mode). Populated only when `collect_env(buck_target=...)`
  is invoked (or `aorta env probe --buck-target ...`); see
  [`buck_introspect.py`](buck_introspect.py) for the matched library
  set. Outside Buck mode the existing per-library blocks
  (`hipblaslt`, `rocblas`, `miopen`, `rccl`, ...) remain authoritative.

## env probe quick reference

### Library API (the primary deliverable; B1 / B2 call this in-process)

```python
from aorta.instrumentation.environment import collect_env, EnvSnapshot

snapshot: EnvSnapshot = collect_env()   # NEVER raises

# Embed in a trial result and serialise
trial_result["env"] = snapshot.to_dict()

# Reconstruct from a previously persisted env.json blob
rebuilt = EnvSnapshot.from_dict(loaded_json["env"])

# Quick human summary (multi-line per-block brief, ~18 lines on a
# populated host; no external dependencies)
print(snapshot.summary())
```

`EnvSnapshot` is a `@dataclass(frozen=True)` mirroring the env.json
schema 1-to-1. `frozen=True` prevents attribute rebinding on the
snapshot itself (`snap.rocm = ...` raises), but does NOT deep-freeze
the nested `dict` / `list` containers -- treat embedded snapshots as
read-only and `deepcopy(snap.to_dict())` before mutating if you need
to.

### CLI (thin wrapper over `collect_env()`)

```bash
# Default path: ./env.json
aorta env probe

# Custom path; parent dirs are created if missing
aorta env probe -o runs/exp1/env.json

# Buck mode with an explicitly confirmed default context.
aorta env probe --buck-target //app:trainer --buck-default-context

# Or reproduce ordered context inputs.
aorta env probe \
  --buck-target //app:trainer \
  --buck-option mode=root//mode/debug \
  --buck-option config=build.profile=debug \
  --buck-option modifier=//constraints:linux
```

After the run, `cat env.json` reveals the same dict that
`snapshot.to_dict()` returns. The CLI also prints a per-block summary
brief to stdout (currently ~18 lines on a populated host -- one labelled
cell per top-level block); see [`docs/env-probe.md#cli`](../../../docs/env-probe.md#cli)
for the live example output.

### Installing RDHC for full `system_health` coverage

`rdhc` (ROCm Deployment Health Check) is a system tool from the
[`rocm-systems`](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/main/projects/rocm-core/rdhc)
repo, NOT a Python package. Aorta wraps it but does not vendor it -- if
absent, the env probe still produces a complete snapshot with
`system_health: null` and a `partial_reasons` entry pointing at the
install path.

It is not in `requirements.txt` because:

* `rdhc` is not on PyPI.
* Hard-pinning would break aorta on non-ROCm hosts, stripped ROCm
  docker images, and CPU-only CI runners.
* The fail-soft contract is the design: every snapshot is honest about
  what it could and could not capture, the run continues either way.

For the install commands (Ubuntu / RHEL / SLES / source), the
passwordless-sudo recipe, and verification steps, see the user-facing
guide: [`docs/env-probe.md`](../../../docs/env-probe.md#installing-rdhc).

### Fail-soft contract (`partial` / `partial_reasons`)

`collect_env()` is documented as **never raises**. Two layers enforce
that:

1. Every probe is individually fail-soft. If a probe falls back to
   `None` (rdhc not installed, /opt/rocm absent, hipconfig missing,
   torch absent, ...), it appends a human-readable line to a shared
   `partial_reasons: list[str]`. The snapshot's top-level `partial: bool`
   is then `True`.
2. The orchestrator body is wrapped in a top-level `try / except
   Exception`. If anything truly unexpected raises (a stdlib call
   misbehaves, a future probe is buggy, ...), the disaster-recovery
   helper `_disaster_snapshot` constructs a fully-shaped `EnvSnapshot`
   from defaults with the exception captured in `partial_reasons`.
   Even the helper guards its own `_utc_now_iso` and
   `platform.python_version` calls.

Documented absences DO NOT trigger `partial`:

* `docker == None` on baremetal (no container, nothing to record).
* `env_vars[X] == None` for an unset env var (the documented contract).
* `runtime_context.venv_path == None` outside a venv.

For a Buck ``.par`` whose application owns ``__main__``, add `aorta_lib` to
the application's dependencies and call `capture_to()` near the beginning of
its existing `main()`:

```python
from aorta.instrumentation.environment import capture_to

capture_to("env.workload.json", probe_invocation="buck2_run")
```

This captures the workload process. Keep client-side `--buck-target`
introspection in a separate snapshot; a remote action may not have access to
the Buck daemon or checkout needed for a nested cquery.

### env.json schema (v1.15)

See `EnvSnapshot` in [`environment.py`](environment.py) for the
authoritative shape and field-by-field docstrings. Top-level keys:

```
schema_version    captured_at       host                runtime_context
container_detected execution_context probe_namespace    docker
rocm              amdgpu_driver     hip                 gpu_arch
nics              hipblaslt         rocblas             composable_kernel
tensile           tensile_catalog   miopen              miopen_catalog
rocfft_catalog    rccl              triton              fbgemm

pytorch_version   pytorch_build     pytorch_sdpa        env_vars
system_health     partial           partial_reasons
```

For the per-version field history (renames, env-var additions /
removals), see the changelog comment next to `SCHEMA_VERSION` in
`environment.py` or the "Schema changelog" section of
[`docs/env-probe.md`](../../../docs/env-probe.md#schema-changelog).

Schema is **stable + versioned**. Add fields freely; never rename or
remove without bumping `schema_version`. Empty `applied_prs: {}` may
gain `pr_<id>_applied` keys later -- that is additive and does not bump
the version.

## How to add a new env var to `CANONICAL_ENV_VARS`

The env var list is **explicit, not prefix matching**, and it is
**generated** from the provenance manifest `ENV_KNOB_REGISTRY` in
`src/aorta/instrumentation/env_knobs.py`. Adding a variable is a
deliberate three-step change so that what we capture stays auditable
and reviewable.

1. **Add one `EnvironmentKnob`** to `ENV_KNOB_REGISTRY`, recording
   `name`, `library`, `consumer`, `category` (from `CATEGORIES`),
   `source_reference` and `reference_build`. `CANONICAL_ENV_VARS` is
   derived from the manifest, so there is no second list to edit, and
   the order you add it in is the order it appears in a snapshot.

   Record what you actually verified. If you did not trace the variable
   to an upstream call site, mark it `INHERITED_UNAUDITED` rather than
   citing a source you did not check -- an invented provenance is worse
   than an admitted gap.

2. **Update the stability-guard test**:
   `tests/instrumentation/test_environment.py::TestEnvVars::test_canonical_var_names_stable`
   This is a literal `assert set(...) == {...}` over the generated
   list. Without updating it, your PR fails. The test exists to force
   you to acknowledge that adding a variable is a schema-shape change
   reviewers care about. Note what it does *not* do: because both sides
   are hand-written, it cannot show that the upstream libraries are
   covered. That is what `scripts/audit_env_knobs.py` measures -- run it
   for any GEMM knob, and see
   [docs/env-probe.md](../../../docs/env-probe.md#auditing-what-the-manifest-covers).

3. **Document the addition** in your PR description: which workload /
   library uses it, and a pointer to the upstream source or
   documentation.

**What "belongs here" means.** Capture is *comprehensive*, and the
classification is *recorded rather than used as a filter*. A variable
does not have to change behaviour observably to be captured -- knobs
whose only consumer is a print or a client-side report are captured with
`category="gemm_diagnostics"`. Recording a variable never claims it
affected execution; it preserves the declared environment, which is what
makes two snapshots comparable. Earlier revisions excluded report-only
knobs, which made the snapshot's contents depend on our classification
being correct: the 2026-08-02 GEMM audit overturned two of its own
name-based verdicts, so that judgement now lives in `category` /
`consumer` where a triager can weigh it.

What does **not** belong here:

* **Workload config** like `AMP_DTYPE`, `MODEL_DTYPE`, model precision, or
  optimizer hyperparameters. Those are training-script arguments
  (Hydra/argparse), captured by `aorta run` in the trial result
  (Task B1). Some workloads forward them as env vars to subprocesses --
  the env probe still does NOT capture them, since they are workload
  state, not environment state.
* **Anything you can capture by reading a file or running a tool**
  (rocm version, hipconfig output, etc.). Those go in their own block.

## How to add a new probe block

Roughly the same pattern as the existing blocks (`_run_rdhc`,
`_capture_rocm_version_files`, `_capture_hip_toolchain`, ...):

1. Define probe constants (filesystem paths, command names) at module
   scope, paired with provenance comments. Add to the
   `TestPathConstants` parametrize list and the
   `test_known_constant_set_is_stable` set.
2. Write the probe as `_capture_<block>(reasons: list[str]) -> dict | None`.
   It MUST NOT raise; catch every error path and return `None` plus a
   `reasons.append(f"<block>.<field>: <reason>")` line.
3. Add a field to `EnvSnapshot` and update `_disaster_snapshot` to
   give it a sane default. The
   `test_disaster_snapshot_populates_every_envsnapshot_field` test
   forces this -- it enumerates `dataclasses.fields(EnvSnapshot)` and
   fails if any are missing from the disaster path.
4. Wire into `collect_env()`'s body inside the `try` block.
5. Bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` if the addition isn't strictly additive
   (renaming / removing a field never bumps; adding always-present
   keys is additive).

## Tests

`tests/instrumentation/test_environment.py` has 500+ tests (run
`pytest --collect-only -q tests/instrumentation/test_environment.py | tail -1`
for the live count) covering:

* Schema completeness (every top-level key present in every snapshot)
* Round-trip via `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` (incl. through JSON,
  forward-compat with extra keys)
* `collect_env()` never raises (probe-fail and unexpected-exception paths)
* Per-probe behaviour (RDHC happy + four failure modes, ROCm files,
  hipconfig, hipblaslt header parsing + lib hashing + tensile
  fingerprint, runtime context detection, Docker metadata, env vars,
  PyTorch version)
* B1/B2-style integration: snapshot embeds in fake trial result and
  round-trips through JSON
* Idempotency: two calls produce equivalent snapshots
* CLI thin-wrapper invariant (line count + no probing imports)
* No-GPU-compute guard via fake torch in `sys.modules`
* Disaster-snapshot completeness via `dataclasses.fields()`

Run them with:

```bash
pytest tests/instrumentation/test_environment.py -v
```

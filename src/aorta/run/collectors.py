"""Collector recipe registry.

Collectors are profiling / instrumentation tools attached to a workload run via
``--collect`` or a recipe's ``collect:`` block. This module is the dispatch
layer between the reserved ``_aorta_collect*`` config keys the dispatcher
threads into every trial and the per-collector packages under
:mod:`aorta.instrumentation`.

Supported recipes:
    rocprof: ``rocprofv3`` kernel/API tracing (:mod:`aorta.instrumentation.rocprof`)
    proton: Triton Proton profiler (:mod:`aorta.instrumentation.proton`)
    numerics: Numeric health monitoring (NaN/Inf detection)
    layer_numerics: Per-layer NaN/magnitude logger (:mod:`aorta.instrumentation.layer_numerics`)
    amd_log: AMD internal logging collector

``rocprof`` and ``proton`` attach generically, by wrapping the launch argv --
the same seam :func:`aorta.emulation.mirage_launch.wrap_argv_for_environment`
uses -- so any subprocess-shaped workload, including an opaque ``aorta probe --
<command>``, can be profiled. The remaining names are still validated-only:
they are consumed by workload wrappers that opt in (see the ``layer_numerics``
package docstring).

"""Layout-agnostic discovery of the installed ROCm tree (issue #381).

ROCm ships in two on-disk shapes and we must read both:

* **classic** -- a system install rooted at ``/opt/rocm`` (DEB/RPM packages
  and SDK tarballs). One root holds ``bin/``, ``include/``, ``lib/`` and
  ``share/``. This is what customers run and it is *not* deprecated.
* **wheel** -- TheRock's Python distribution (ROCm 7.14+, and what
  ``rocm/pytorch:latest`` is). There is no ``/opt/rocm`` at all. The tree is
  split across sibling packages under ``site-packages``:
  ``_rocm_sdk_core`` (``bin/``, ``include/``, ``.info/version``,
  ``share/therock/``), ``_rocm_sdk_libraries`` (the math libraries, their
  Tensile kernel databases and ``share/miopen/db``), and optionally
  ``_rocm_sdk_devel`` (the development headers).

Because those two shapes disagree about which root holds what, resolution
yields **three** roots rather than one. On a classic install all three are
the same directory, so every path derived from them is byte-identical to the
hardcoded ``/opt/rocm/...`` constants this replaced -- the classic path does
not change behaviour.

Measured, not assumed. On the wheel image ``aorta-rocm_7.15.0a20260716``:
``/opt/rocm`` is genuinely absent, ``ROCM_PATH`` and ``ROCM_HOME`` are
**both unset** (so neither is a usable layout discriminator -- see the
warning in ``docs/ci-testing-plan.md``), ``.info/version`` exists at
``_rocm_sdk_core/.info/version``, ``libhipblaslt.so.1`` lives in
``_rocm_sdk_libraries/lib``, and the Tensile database is one level deeper
than on classic (``lib/hipblaslt/library/gfx950/`` vs a flat
``lib/hipblaslt/library/``).

This module deliberately imports nothing beyond the standard library and
performs no subprocess calls, so the standalone CI scripts
(``scripts/audit_env_knobs.py``, ``scripts/ci/nightly_eval.py``,
``scripts/sanitizers/prepare_gemm_isa.py``) can use the same resolver as the
env probe without pulling in torch.

    i.e. at least one of the two things every caller wants (the version for the
    probe and the dashboard, ``lib/`` for the env-knob audit and the Tensile
    database).

    Why the asymmetry: autodetection has to *outrank an importable wheel*, and
    "the directory exists and has a ``bin/``" is not evidence enough to do that.
    A wheel-based image can reasonably ship a bin-only ``/opt/rocm`` compat shim

    null version on a perfectly working box, which is the failure mode #381
    exists to remove rather than relocate. An explicit override keeps the loose
    test, because there the operator has stated intent and ``root_source`` says
    so.

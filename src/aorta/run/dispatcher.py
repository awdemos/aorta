"""Run dispatcher - orchestrates workload execution across trials.

The dispatcher is the core of `aorta run`. It:
1. Discovers and instantiates workloads
2. Validates launch mode before execution
3. Applies environment and mitigation configuration
4. Runs trials and collects results
5. Persists results as JSON (rank 0 only for distributed)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RunRequest:
    """Configuration for a run_trials() invocation.

    The dataclass is ``frozen=True`` to prevent attribute reassignment,
    but ``extra_env`` and ``config_overrides`` are dicts -- ``frozen``
    does not stop callers from mutating those nested structures.
    ``__post_init__`` therefore stores deep copies, so an in-flight
    request can never be mutated out from under the dispatcher.  This
    mirrors the same defensive pattern used by :class:`TrialResult`.

    Note:
        :class:`TrialResult.execution_env` records the *effective*
        recipe (the declared environment plus any runtime overlays
        from CLI flags such as ``--buck-target``).  Replays should
        read ``execution_env`` field-by-field, not re-resolve the
        named environment, when overlays were used -- otherwise the
        replay silently drops the overlay and runs against a
        different recipe than the original trial.

    Attributes:
        workload: Name of the workload to run (from entry-point group).
        trials: Number of trials to execute.
        environment: Environment name (default: local).
        image: Optional runtime overlay for the resolved
            :class:`Environment`'s ``docker`` field. Symmetric peer
            of ``buck_target`` below: each overlays one axis of the
            named environment's recipe at run time and preserves the
            other axes (a single-axis pin). When set, takes effect
            AFTER :func:`get_environment` resolves ``environment``;
            ``None`` (the default) means "no override" so every
            pre-existing ``RunRequest`` invocation behaves unchanged.
            **Naming asymmetry**: the FIELD overlays
            ``Environment.docker`` (the recipe slot's name, peer of
            ``venv`` / ``buck_target``); the FIELD itself is named
            ``image`` (after the VALUE the operator provides -- an
            OCI image reference, typically a digest pin like
            ``sha256:<64-hex>`` or ``<repo>@sha256:<digest>``). Same
            convention as the CLI flag (``--image``). Threaded into
            ``config['_aorta_environment']['docker']`` for the
            workload's wrapper to consume. **Keyword-only**: same
            ``kw_only=True`` rationale as ``buck_target`` -- adding
            this field before existing positional fields like
            ``mitigations`` would otherwise shift their positional
            slots and silently break external positional callers.
        buck_target: Optional runtime overlay for the resolved
            :class:`Environment`'s ``buck_target`` field (#182). When
            set, takes effect AFTER :func:`get_environment` resolves
            ``environment``, so the named environment's other fields
            (``docker`` / ``venv`` / ``source_package``) are
            preserved -- the override is a pin on the Buck axis only.
            ``None`` (the default) means "no override": a named env
            that already declares ``buck_target`` keeps its value,
            and every pre-existing ``RunRequest`` invocation behaves
            unchanged. Symmetric peer of ``aorta env probe
            --buck-target`` (#163). Threaded into
            ``config['_aorta_environment']['buck_target']`` for the
            workload's wrapper to consume. **Keyword-only**: this
            field is declared with ``kw_only=True`` so adding it
            before existing positional fields like ``mitigations``
            does NOT shift the positional ``__init__`` signature
            (positional callers continue to interpret the 4th arg as
            ``mitigations``).
        mitigations: Tuple of mitigation names to apply.
        extra_env: Additional environment variables (override mitigations).
        trial_isolation: ``auto`` follows workload metadata; ``process`` uses
            a fresh interpreter per trial; ``in_process`` keeps the legacy
            lifecycle when permitted by the workload.
        steps: Number of steps per trial (workload-specific).
        config_overrides: Additional workload configuration.
        results_dir: Directory to write per-trial JSON files.
        collect: Collector recipe names, threaded to
            ``config['_aorta_collect']`` for the workload to act on.
        collect_options: Per-collector option dicts (name -> {knob: value}),
            threaded to ``config['_aorta_collect_options']`` when non-empty.
        sidecar_files: JSON sidecar files describing ad-hoc mitigations
            and/or environments (B3.1).  Forwarded to
            ``aorta.registry.get_mitigation`` /
            ``aorta.registry.get_environment`` so that names declared in
            the sidecar resolve in the same call as built-ins and
            entry-point plugins.
        dataset_index: Cell coordinate on the dataset / environment axis,
            used in ``trial_id`` and the per-trial JSON filename.
            ``aorta run`` is one cell, so the default ``0`` is correct
            for direct CLI use; ``aorta triage`` (B2) calls
            ``run_trials`` once per cell and varies this index across
            its environment axis so cells in the matrix don't collide
            on disk.
        mitigation_index: Cell coordinate on the mitigation axis (same
            rationale as ``dataset_index``).  ``aorta triage`` varies
            this across its mitigation axis; ``aorta run`` always emits
            ``m0``.
        save_logs: When ``True``, capture the workload's in-process
            ``stdout`` / ``stderr`` writes to per-trial files alongside
            the trial JSON (``trial_d{d}_m{m}_t{t}.{stdout,stderr}.log``).
            Default ``False`` preserves today's behaviour (no capture).
            Both file capture and the reserved-key injection described
            below are **rank-0 only** -- matches the trial-JSON write
            guarantee. Wrappers running on non-rank-0 won't see the
            keys and should treat capture as off there.
            ``contextlib.redirect_*`` only catches Python-level writes;
            subprocesses are not captured. Wrappers that own a
            subprocess can opt in by reading the platform-supplied
            ``_aorta_save_logs`` / ``_aorta_log_prefix`` config keys
            this dispatcher injects; the prefix is an absolute
            path-with-stem rooted in the per-workload results
            subdirectory (e.g. ``<results_dir>/<workload>/trial_d0_m0_t0``,
            anchored via ``Path.absolute()`` so a relative
            ``RunRequest.results_dir`` still yields a usable prefix)
            and the wrapper derives a non-colliding sibling path such as
            ``<prefix>.subprocess.{stdout,stderr}.log`` -- the
            dispatcher already holds open the
            ``<prefix>.{stdout,stderr}.log`` paths and double-writing
            them would race.

            The ``redirect_*`` rebinding is process-wide. Today no
            caller invokes ``run_trials`` from multiple threads
            concurrently (``aorta run`` is one cell, ``aorta triage``
            iterates cells serially), so cross-thread crosstalk is
            theoretical. If that ever changes, this knob would need a
            different capture mechanism -- this mirrors the same
            single-caller assumption the env-restore block on this
            function relies on.
        subprocess_argv: Opaque ``argv`` forwarded byte-for-byte to a
            subprocess-shaped workload. The dispatcher injects this
            tuple into the workload config as the reserved
            ``_aorta_subprocess_argv`` key after ``config_overrides``
            is merged, so user-supplied ``config_overrides`` cannot
            collide (the reserved-prefix rejection at the top of
            ``run_trials`` enforces this). Only consumed today by
            :class:`aorta.workloads._subprocess.SubprocessWorkload`,
            which ``aorta probe`` wires up; other workloads ignore
            the key. ``None`` (the default) leaves the key unset so
            existing single-process workloads round-trip exactly as
            before. Carrying ``argv`` here -- rather than letting it
            leak into ``config_overrides`` -- preserves the "no
            user-supplied ``_aorta_*`` keys" invariant and makes the
            data-flow visible in the dataclass surface.
        probe_extras: Opaque probe-mode metadata bundle injected into
            the workload config as the reserved ``_aorta_probe_extras``
            key, post-``config_overrides`` merge. Consumed only by
            :class:`aorta.workloads._subprocess.SubprocessWorkload`
            (Phase 1) to know its cell name, the requested
            ``env_passthrough_mode``, the per-trial timeout, and the
            resolved cell env-var bundle. ``None`` (default) leaves
            the key unset so non-probe workloads see no change.

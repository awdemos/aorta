# Triage recipes

> **Renamed (issue #248):** `aorta triage` and `aorta probe` are now the
> single command **`aorta sweep`**. Use `aorta sweep run` everywhere this
> guide says `aorta triage run`, and `aorta sweep run ... -- <cmd>` for the
> subprocess (former `aorta probe`) flow. The old commands still work as
> deprecated aliases that print a notice and delegate to the same engine.

A triage **recipe** is the authoritative description of an `aorta sweep run --mode matrix`
invocation: which `(mitigation x environment)` cells to run,
per-cell trial / step counts, the ticket the matrix belongs to, and the
speed-confound detection config.

Recipes are the primary interface. The `--mode matrix` flag shim is kept as
an escape hatch for ad-hoc one-shots; internally it constructs an in-memory
`Recipe` and reuses the same execution path.

## Before you run

Commands in this repository assume the repository root unless stated
otherwise. For installation and host/container ownership, see
[Where commands run](../README.md#where-commands-run) and the selected
workload's guide.

## Layout

Recipes are grouped by workload:

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `training/` | DDP / FSDP training smoke recipes. |
| `inference/` | Offline / continuous inference smoke recipes. |
| `llm-determinism/` | Bit-exact double-run determinism probe. |
| `race/` | RCCL race / SDC reproducers (incl. AINIC/Pollara GDR). |
| `hrx/` | HRX launch-probe and perf (GEMM / triad) recipes. |
| `probe/` | Subprocess-flow templates for wrapping opaque launch commands. |
| `emulated/` | Variants that run under the mirage GPU emulator (no real GPU). |

## Schema rules (full detail)

- **`schema_version`** -- required `int`; currently `1`. Unknown values raise
  `RecipeSchemaError`.
- **`ticket`** -- optional string; format-free. Absent tickets route output
  to `triage_results/_no_ticket_/...`.
- **`workload`** -- required string; must resolve via `aorta.workloads`
  entry-point group at runtime. Unknown names surface as cell-level errors,
  not load-time errors, because workload discovery is B1's job.
- **`trials` / `steps`** -- required ints at top level; per-cell overrides
  allowed.
- **`confound.threshold`** -- optional float, default `1.15`.
- **`confound.baseline_cell`** -- optional string. Resolution order if
  absent: (1) first cell named `baseline-*`; (2) first cell with
  `mitigations == ["none"]`; (3) single-cell recipes default to that cell;
  (4) error.
- **`cells[*].name`** -- required string, unique within the recipe. Used as
  the `matrix.md` row label and the `cells/<name>/` directory name. Must
  match `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.\-]*$` (no path separators, no leading
  `-`, no `.` / `..`); reserved names like `matrix.md` / `matrix.json` are
  also rejected so a cell can't clobber a sibling artifact.
- **`cells[*].mitigations`** -- required `list[str]`. Each name resolved
  through `aorta.registry.get_mitigation()`. Empty list rejected (use
  `["none"]` for the explicit baseline). Multiple names union their
  env-var bundles in list order. **Stacked mitigations must agree on
  overlapping keys**: if two bundles set the same env var to different
  values the recipe is rejected at load time. Use `extra_env` to
  intentionally override.
- **`cells[*].environment`** -- required. Either:
  - a registered environment name (resolved via `aorta.registry.get_environment()`), OR
  - a mapping `{docker: "<image-ref>", env: {KEY: "VALUE"}}` -- inline
    docker shorthand with optional baseline environment variables.
    Auto-named `_inline_<hash>`. For legacy mappings with no `env` (or an
    empty mapping), the hash remains the first 8 hex chars of
    `blake2b(image-ref)`. Non-empty `env` content is included canonically in
    the identity, so the same image with different baseline variables cannot
    silently collapse into one environment. No other keys are accepted.
    This is metadata passed to the workload; it does not make the core
    dispatcher launch a container. A Docker-aware plugin must consume it.
- **Top-level `extra_env`** -- optional `dict[str, str]`. Applied to every
  cell after `Environment.env` and mitigations. Probe-mode recipes reject this
  triage-only key and retain their separate environment-passthrough contract.
- **`cells[*].extra_env`** -- optional `dict[str, str]`. Applied AFTER the
  recipe-level mapping, so it can override a recipe default or registered
  mitigation for one-off experiments without polluting the registry. Recorded
  in `matrix.json` for audit. All environment mappings require string keys and
  values; quote YAML numbers and booleans.

### Trial isolation and environment timing

`trial_isolation` is a top-level triage field:

- `auto` (default) follows workload metadata.
- `process` starts a fresh Python interpreter for every trial and installs the
  controlled environment before imports.
- `in_process` keeps the legacy lifecycle and is rejected when the workload
  requires isolation.

Use normal `extra_env` in process-isolated recipes even for import-time native
settings. For example, `race` requires process isolation, so its AINIC cells can
vary `NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL`, `NCCL_GDR_FLUSH_DISABLE`, `NCCL_PROTO`, and
`GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES` safely. In an in-process workload, values cached during
module/shared-library import still need the launcher environment or an explicit
`trial_isolation: process` recipe.

Launcher identity (`RANK`, `WORLD_SIZE`, `LOCAL_RANK`, `MASTER_ADDR`,
`MASTER_PORT`) is never a cell axis and is rejected from a process-isolated
controlled overlay.

`Environment.env`, mitigations, and recipe/cell `extra_env` keep their existing
precedence; process isolation changes when the resolved overlay becomes visible,
not how it is merged. For distributed details, see
[`README-running-recipes.md`](README-running-recipes.md).

- **`save_logs`** -- optional `bool`, default `false`. When `true`, the
  dispatcher captures the workload's in-process `stdout` / `stderr`
  writes into `trial_d{d}_m{m}_t{t}.{stdout,stderr}.log` files alongside
  the trial JSON. Both the file capture and the reserved-key injection
  described below are **rank-0 only** (matches the trial-JSON write
  guarantee); wrappers running on non-rank-0 won't see the keys and
  should treat capture as off there.
  `contextlib.redirect_*` only catches Python-level writes; workloads
  that spawn subprocesses don't have their subprocess output captured
  automatically. Those
  wrappers can opt in by reading the platform-supplied
  `_aorta_save_logs` / `_aorta_log_prefix` config keys the dispatcher
  injects, and writing their own capture to a sibling path derived from
  the prefix (e.g. `<prefix>.subprocess.stdout.log`). The prefix is an
  absolute path-with-stem rooted in the per-workload results
  subdirectory (e.g. `<results_dir>/<workload>/trial_d0_m0_t0`,
  anchored via `Path.absolute()` so a relative `results_dir` still
  yields a usable prefix), so wrappers don't need to know
  `results_dir`. The dispatcher already holds the
  `<prefix>.{stdout,stderr}.log` paths open, so wrappers must NOT
  write to them directly.
- **`collect`** -- optional `list[str]` or mapping, default absent (no
  collectors). Names one or more cross-cutting collectors to attach to every
  cell: `[rocprof]` or `[proton]` to attach a GPU profiler
  ([`docs/profiling-collectors.md`](../docs/profiling-collectors.md)),
  `[layer_numerics]` for the per-layer NaN/magnitude logger. Valid in
  `mode: probe` recipes as well as triage recipes -- the profiling collectors
  attach by wrapping the launch argv, so they are meaningful for an opaque
  `-- <command>` run.
  List form enables collectors with default options; mapping form passes
  per-collector options:

  ```yaml
  # list form (default options):
  collect: [layer_numerics]

  # mapping form (per-collector options):
  collect:
    layer_numerics:
      NANLOG_SAMPLE_EVERY: "10"

  # recommended: one structured NANLOG_SPEC value (see docs/layer-numerics.md):
  collect:
    layer_numerics:
      NANLOG_SPEC: '{"follow":[{"tensor":"embedding_features","at":"stage","bounds":[0,60]}],"sample_every":50}'
  ```

  Cells may also set `collect:`. An absent cell key inherits the recipe-level
  collectors, a present value replaces the recipe-level collectors for that
  cell, and `collect: []` disables collectors for that cell. The same mapping
  form is accepted at cell scope. CLI `--collect` is an operator override and
  applies to every cell, clearing any per-cell collector overrides.

  Unknown collector names are rejected at load time (validated against
  `aorta.run.collectors.KNOWN_RECIPES`), as are per-collector options outside
  their declared schema and collector combinations that cannot run together
  (`rocprof` alongside a queue-intercepting `proton` backend).

  `rocprof` and `proton` need **no workload opt-in** -- the platform launches
  them itself in the subprocess seam and parses their artifacts into
  `rocprof_*` / `proton_*` trial metrics. The caveat below is specific to
  `layer_numerics`.

  For `layer_numerics` (the per-layer NaN/magnitude logger), see
  [`docs/layer-numerics.md`](../docs/layer-numerics.md) for worked Stage 1 /
  Stage 2 `collect:` examples and the `NANLOG_*` options. **Opt-in caveat:** the
  engine validates the collector name and threads it (with any `NANLOG_*`
  options) into the workload config, but does not launch the logger itself — a
  workload must read `_aorta_collect` and run its entry through the logger for
  output to be produced. The built-in workloads do not, so a
  `collect: [layer_numerics]` recipe on a built-in workload validates and runs
  without producing logger output; use the standalone path documented in the
  guide for a guaranteed capture.
- **`workload_config`** -- optional `dict[str, Any]`, allowed at both
  recipe scope (top level) and per cell. Forwarded to the workload
  constructor through the dispatcher's `Request.config_overrides`. Use
  this for workload-specific knobs that aren't env vars; it does not enter
  `os.environ` or `_aorta_trial_env`. For example, a plugin may use
  `algorithm: alternate` to select one implementation.
  Cell-scope merges over recipe-scope on a per-key basis (cell wins on
  collision; non-collision keys union),
  so a recipe can set a workload-wide default and opt one cell out.
  Reserved keys: `"steps"` (first-class field; would be silently
  overwritten by the dispatcher) and any `_aorta_*` prefix
  (platform-supplied) are rejected at load time. Example:

  ```yaml
  workload: my_workload
  workload_config:
    algorithm: standard       # recipe default
  cells:
    - name: baseline-local
      mitigations: [none]
      environment: local
    - name: alternate-local
      mitigations: [none]
      environment: local
      workload_config:
        algorithm: alternate  # cell override
  ```

Every validation error reports a path like `cells[2].mitigations` so the
failure is localisable without reading the loader source.

The complete environment-variable precedence is:

```text
Environment.env
< mitigations
< recipe-level extra_env
< cell-level extra_env
```

Direct `aorta run --extra-env` occupies the same highest-precedence request
layer as the recipe runner's merged recipe/cell values. The dispatcher applies
the controlled overlay to host workloads and injects the exact same mapping as
`config["_aorta_trial_env"]` for self-isolating wrappers. It never adds
unrelated ambient host variables, and the core dispatcher does not execute
`docker run`. Docker-aware wrappers can use `aorta.run.docker_env_flags`; see
[`docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md#workload-owned-docker-launches).

## Workloads

The `workload:` name is resolved through the `aorta.workloads` entry-point
group at **cell-execution time, not recipe-load time**. A recipe naming an
unregistered workload loads and validates fine; it fails per-cell when the
cell runs. So "the recipe is valid" does not imply "the workload exists" --
confirm registration with a dry-run (or `pip install -e .` after adding a
new entry-point).

### `race`

Wraps the in-tree RCCL race reproducer (`aorta.race`). `launch_mode:
distributed`, `min_world_size: 2`. The communication pattern is selected by
the `mode` config key, not by a separate workload name:

```yaml
workload: race
workload_config:
  mode: fsdp            # default | ddp | fsdp
  warmup_iterations: 0
  verify_iterations: 50
  dtype: bfloat16       # bfloat16 | float16 | float32
```

`workload_config` accepts any field of
`aorta.race.config.ReproducerConfig` (e.g. `h2d_tensor_size`,
`fsdp_shard_size`, `gemm_layers`, `simulate_compute`, `h2d_prefetch`,
`same_stream_mode`, `stop_on_first_corruption`, `log_interval`).

Because `race` is `launch_mode: distributed`, it MUST be launched under
torchrun (a bare `aorta sweep run` starts one process, WORLD_SIZE=1, and is
refused by launch-mode validation). Use the `aorta` console script as
torchrun's target -- `-m aorta` is not a runnable module:

```bash
# validate only (no GPUs / no launcher):
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/training/example-fsdp-smoke.yaml --dry-run

# single node, 2 ranks (bump --nproc_per_node to your GPU count):
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 $(which aorta) sweep run \
  --recipe recipes/training/example-fsdp-smoke.yaml

# multi-node, 1 rank per host (AINIC/Pollara -- 1 process owns all GPUs on the node):
torchrun --nnodes=N --nproc_per_node=1 --rdzv-backend=c10d \
  --rdzv-endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:29500 $(which aorta) sweep run \
  --recipe recipes/training/example-fsdp-smoke.yaml

# multi-node, 1 rank per GPU (IB / NVLink / generic fabric):
torchrun --nnodes=N --nproc_per_node=8 --rdzv-backend=c10d \
  --rdzv-endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:29500 $(which aorta) sweep run \
  --recipe recipes/training/example-fsdp-smoke.yaml
```

Each rank runs the full `sweep run`; the ranks find each other in
`dist.init_process_group()`. The long-lived matrix parent on every rank starts
a fresh worker for each Race trial; matching workers initialize the trial
process group, synchronize their result, tear it down, and exit before the next
trial starts. Results are written by **rank 0 only**, so multi-rank launches do
not clobber each other. `llm_determinism` uses the same worker model only when
its recipe requests `trial_isolation: process`.

### Race smoke recipes

| Recipe | Purpose | Fabric |
|---|---|---|
| `recipes/race/race_smoke.yaml` | Fabric-agnostic sanity check (1 trial, 5 iters, model_dim=512). Works on NVLink, IB, AINIC, or SHM. | Any |
| `recipes/race/ainic-smoke.yaml` | Same but forces `NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL=SYS` + dmabuf + GDR read to validate the AINIC/Pollara GDR path specifically. | AINIC only |

Confirmed working on a single node with 8 GPUs (one rank per GPU):

```bash
# single node, 8 GPUs:
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 $(which aorta) sweep run \
  --recipe recipes/race/race_smoke.yaml
```

A green run proves: `compute_type=transformer`, `layers_verified > 0`, `layer_checksum_mismatches == 0`, `passed=true`. Use `recipes/race/ainic-gdr-flush-sdc.yaml` for the full SDC triage matrix.

```

`matrix.json` per-cell shape (the canonical machine-readable record):

- `failure_rate` -- fraction of trials with `exit_status != ok` OR
  `WorkloadResult.passed == False`. NOT a NaN-specific rate; see
  `exit_status_counts` to disambiguate failure modes.
- `exit_status_counts` -- histogram keyed by `TrialResult.exit_status`
  (`"ok"`, `"workload_failed"`, `"infrastructure_failed"`, ...). Total
  equals the cell's trial count.
- `min_step_time_ms`, `max_step_time_ms`, `p50_step_time_ms`,
  `p90_step_time_ms`, `p99_step_time_ms` -- summary stats over the
  concatenated per-trial step-time series.
- `mean_step_time_ms`, `std_step_time_ms`, `mean_wall_clock_sec` --
  unchanged; still the headline timing fields.
- `step_times_ms` -- raw concatenated series for downstream re-analysis.
- `step_time_source` -- which branch of the fallback ladder produced the
  cell's step-times: `"per_step"` (workload's own `step_times_ms`),
  `"elapsed_per_iter"` (`elapsed_sec / total_iterations`),
  `"wall_clock_total"` (`wall_clock_sec / steps`, folds in setup /
  teardown), or `"missing"` (no usable timing). Confound classification
  refuses to compute a ratio between cells whose sources differ -- those
  rows are marked `n/a` in `matrix.md` -- so a workload that only exposes
  wall-clock can't be silently compared against one that emits per-step
  timing.
- `resolved_env_vars` -- the controlled env-var bundle as actually applied
  (`Environment.env`, mitigation union, and merged recipe/cell `extra_env` in
  precedence order).
- `resolved_environment` -- the resolved `Environment` descriptor.
- `workload_config` -- the merged per-cell `workload_config` dict (recipe
  scope union cell scope, cell wins on collision). Empty `{}` when neither
  scope sets it. `matrix.md` surfaces keys whose value varies across cells
  in a `Config` column (diffs only; the column is hidden when no cell has
  workload_config or when every cell agrees on every key).
- `trial_paths` -- per-trial JSON paths, sorted by trial index (NOT
  lexicographically, so `trial_2.json` precedes `trial_10.json`).

**Note on the trailing `<workload>/` directory inside each cell.** B1's
runner (`aorta.run.run_trials`) appends `/<workload>` to the output
directory it was given. B2 honours that contract: each cell is told to
write to `cells/<cell-name>/`, and B1 ends up writing
`cells/<cell-name>/<workload>/trial_N.json`. `matrix.json` records the
real paths; a future B1 follow-up can drop this level of nesting via a
`skip_workload_subdir` kwarg on `RunRequest`.

## Environment snapshots

Every run records the environment each cell ran in under
`environments/<env-name>/env.json`, once per unique environment:

- **Local (non-isolated) envs** are probed in-process: the runner calls
  `collect_env()` directly, because the runner process *is* the trial
  environment. The snapshot is written before the env's first cell runs.
- **Isolated envs** (a registry `Environment` with a `docker:` or `venv:`
  field, or an inline-docker cell) cannot be probed from the runner
  process -- that would record the *host's* Python / ROCm / hipBLASLt
  state, not the isolated env's. Instead the **workload wrapper** captures a
  snapshot from *inside the isolated env* (the container, or the activated
  venv), and the runner promotes it. If the wrapper produces nothing, the
  runner writes a placeholder with `"snapshot_captured": false` and the env
  descriptor. The docker example below is the common case; a venv wrapper
  runs the same probe command in its activated venv using the host
  `src`/`out` paths directly (no bind-mount).

### Wrapper contract for in-container snapshots

For isolated envs the dispatcher injects a reserved
`config["_aorta_env_probe"]` dict with two keys:

- `src` -- absolute path to the aorta `src` tree on the runner host. Bind-mount
  this into the container so the dependency-free probe entry resolves without
  installing aorta in the image.
- `out` -- absolute host path (`environments/<env-name>/env.json`) the runner
  will read after the cell runs. Bind-mount its parent and write there.

A self-isolating wrapper that invokes `docker run` opts in by reading the
reserved config key and running the probe as the first step inside the
container. There are no `AORTA_PROBE_SRC` / `AORTA_ENV_OUT` environment
variables -- the paths arrive only through
`config["_aorta_env_probe"]`, and the wrapper is responsible for turning them
into bind-mounts on the `docker run` it builds:

```python
# inside the wrapper's run(), before building argv:
probe = self.config.get("_aorta_env_probe")   # None for non-isolated envs
mounts, probe_prefix = [], ""
if probe is not None:
    src, out = probe["src"], probe["out"]      # host paths from the runner
    out_dir = os.path.dirname(out)
    mounts = ["-v", f"{src}:/opt/aorta_src:ro", "-v", f"{out_dir}:/aorta_out"]
    probe_prefix = (
        "PYTHONPATH=/opt/aorta_src python -m aorta.instrumentation._probe_main "
        f"/aorta_out/{os.path.basename(out)} && "
    )

argv = [
    "docker", "run", *mounts, image,
    "bash", "-c", f"{probe_prefix}{workload_cmd}",
]
```

`aorta.instrumentation._probe_main` imports only stdlib plus the
`collect_env()` module (no Click), so it runs under a bare container Python
with no `pip install`. It writes exactly the same `env.json` shape as
`aorta env probe -o`, so a promoted in-container snapshot is
indistinguishable on disk from a local-env one.

Probing is **per unique environment**, not per cell: the first cell of each
isolated env requests a probe, and subsequent cells reusing that env keep
requesting one until a valid snapshot is captured (so a cell whose container
fails to start doesn't permanently lose the snapshot). Once captured, later
cells stop requesting it. An env that never produces a valid snapshot gets the
placeholder at the end of the run.

## Re-running a past matrix

Every run writes `recipe.resolved.yaml` alongside the matrix. The file is
**a strict, schema-valid recipe** -- you can pass it back to
`aorta sweep run --recipe ...` directly. Inline-docker cells are
re-emitted in the `{ docker: <ref> }` shorthand so the same
`_inline_<hash>` is re-derived without needing to ship a sidecar JSON
next to the file.

For runs that used `--mitigations-file`, the resolved YAML still
references those mitigation / environment names by name. The runner
snapshots each operator-supplied sidecar into `<run_dir>/sidecars/<basename>`
so the run directory is self-contained for replay. The runner also prints
the exact rerun command on stdout when sidecars are involved, e.g.:

```
cd <run_dir> && aorta sweep run --recipe recipe.resolved.yaml \
  --mitigations-file sidecars/foo.json
```

The per-cell mitigation env-var bundles AS APPLIED, plus the resolved
`Environment` descriptor for each cell, live in `matrix.json` (under
each cell's `resolved_env_vars` and `resolved_environment` keys) -- not
in `recipe.resolved.yaml` -- so the rerun artifact stays loadable while
audit data is still preserved next to the run.

> [!NOTE]
> "Reproducing the same matrix" is up to the registries available at
> rerun time. If a sidecar mitigation's env-var bundle drifts between
> runs the rerun will use the new bundle (snapshotting the *file* doesn't
> pin its *contents* once the operator edits it later). Inline-docker
> cells are immune (the docker ref is in the recipe text itself), but
> registry drift on named entries is currently not pinned. Compare each

## Flag mode (escape hatch)

Example flag-mode CLI:

```
aorta sweep run --mode matrix \
  --workload training \
  --mitigation-axis none,tf32_off,xnack \
  --environment-axis local \
  --trials 2 --steps 100 \
  --ticket EXAMPLE-151
```

Inline docker still works in flag mode via the `image:` prefix on the
axis, e.g. `--environment-axis local,image:rocm/pytorch:nightly`. Each
comma-separated item is parsed independently; bare names go through the
registry, `image:<ref>` maps to the same `{ docker: <ref> }` shorthand as
recipe mode. The value remains workload metadata; a Docker-aware plugin must
consume it.

## Probe handout templates (issue #188 Phase 3)

Generic ``mode: probe`` recipes for customer handouts. Each template
includes a ``redaction:`` block consumed by ``aorta bundle`` when
packaging artifacts for sharing.

Templates live under `recipes/probe/`.

| Template | Typical trailing argv |
|---|---|
| `recipes/probe/probe-template-torchrun.yaml` | `torchrun --nproc_per_node=N train.py ...` |
| `recipes/probe/probe-template-buck2.yaml` | `buck2 run //path:target -- ...` |
| `recipes/probe/probe-template-bash.yaml` | `bash launch.sh ...` |

Dry-run smoke:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/probe/probe-template-bash.yaml --dry-run -- echo hi
```

See `docs/probe/handout-templates.md` for per-template walkthroughs.

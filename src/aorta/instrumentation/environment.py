"""``aorta env probe`` implementation (issue #147).

Library-first per the updated A1 spec: the primary deliverable is

* ``collect_env() -> EnvSnapshot``

which B1 (per-trial runner) and B2 (matrix runner) call **in-process** so
every trial / matrix run records its environment without shelling out.
``aorta env probe`` (CLI) is a thin wrapper around it.

Captured blocks:

* ``system_health`` -- verbatim ``rdhc --quick --json`` output (or null).
* ``rocm`` -- explicit reads of ``/opt/rocm/.info/version{,_dev}`` and
  ``/sys/module/amdgpu/version``.
* ``hip`` -- ``hipconfig`` toolchain outputs.
* ``hipblaslt`` -- commit + library hash + Tensile fingerprint + applied
  PR flags.
* ``rocblas`` -- mirror of ``hipblaslt`` for the rocBLAS library.
* ``composable_kernel`` -- two sub-blocks: ``system`` (header version +
  commit + ck_tile presence from the composablekernel-dev install) and
  ``pytorch_bundled`` (CK symbol count inside ``libtorch_hip.so``).
* ``tensile`` -- optional pip version + combined kernel-DB fingerprint
  across hipBLASLt and rocBLAS.
* ``tensile_catalog`` -- the *recipe book*: installed-library identity
  for the hipBLASLt/rocBLAS Tensile install, consolidating the existing
  version + lib_hash + kernel-DB fingerprints AND a deepened per-file
  enumeration of the frozen Tensile solution menu (logic files:
  ``TensileLibrary`` / ``*.dat`` / ``*.yaml``) -- per-file content
  hashes, a count, and gfx-arch coverage -- so a two-host diff localizes
  *which* logic file differs. This is the menu (what is installed), NOT
  the runtime-selected solution ID (``381881`` / ``368xxx``). No GPU
  compute.
* ``miopen_catalog`` -- the same recipe-book treatment for MIOpen's
  on-disk convolution kernel/find/perf databases
  (``/opt/rocm/share/miopen/db/``). Honors ``MIOPEN_SYSTEM_DB_PATH``.
* ``rocfft_catalog`` -- fingerprint of rocFFT's *optional* ahead-of-time
  ``rocfft_kernel_cache.db`` when present (absence is the common case,
  recorded as ``absent`` rather than partial).
* ``triton``, ``fbgemm``, ``aiter`` -- Python-package version probes.
  ``fbgemm`` also surfaces the ``-DUSE_FBGEMM`` / ``-DUSE_FBGEMM_GENAI``
  build-time flags from ``torch.__config__.show()``.
* ``runtime_context`` -- container runtime + Python env detection.
* ``container_detected`` / ``execution_context`` -- runtime-agnostic
  isolation signal + caller-declared probe placement.
* ``probe_namespace`` -- mismatch-only, hashed namespace observation.
* ``buck_invocation`` -- Buck target + redacted, fingerprinted cquery
  invocation context when Buck introspection is requested.
* ``docker`` -- image + digest when in a container.
* ``env_vars`` -- canonical list of HSA / RCCL / FBGEMM / PyTorch vars.
* ``python_version``, ``pytorch_version``.

Fail-soft contract: ``collect_env()`` NEVER raises. Every probe that falls
back to ``None`` appends a human-readable reason to ``partial_reasons``;
the snapshot is then marked ``partial=True``. This keeps a triage matrix
running when the probe hits something missing (no rdhc, no sudo,
restricted dmesg) instead of aborting the whole run.

No GPU compute. No tensor allocations. Target wall time: <15 s with rdhc
present, <5 s without. Every capture function returns a fully-shaped dict
with ``None`` for missing values, so the schema is stable: keys never go
missing across environments.

SCHEMA_VERSION = "1.16"
# 1.15 -> 1.16 (issue #381: layout-agnostic ROCm discovery). ROCm paths are no
# longer hardcoded to /opt/rocm, so the probe reads a TheRock wheel install as
# well as a classic one. What a snapshot emits changes in four ways:
#   - ``rocm`` gains ``root``, ``lib_root``, ``root_source``, ``layout`` and
#     ``version_source``. A null ROCm version used to be unattributable --
#     "no version file under /opt/rocm" and "no ROCm install at all" read
#     identically. These say which root answered and which source supplied
#     the version.
#   - ``rocm.version`` now falls back past ``.info/version`` to the TheRock
#     manifest, then pip metadata (``rocm`` / ``rocm-sdk-core``), then torch's
#     ``+rocm`` local segment, instead of going null on a stripped install.
#   - a new ``therock`` block records wheel-layout build provenance:
#     full 40-char upstream submodule pins, ``the_rock_commit``,
#     ``github_run_id`` and any applied patches. ``status="absent"`` on a
#     classic install, which ships no manifest -- a documented absence.
#   - ``hipblaslt`` / ``rocblas`` gain ``upstream_commit`` (the full
#     ``rocm-libraries`` pin the version header truncates) and
#     ``upstream_commit_matches_tweak``. Without this the hipBLASLt commit --
#     core evidence in the NaN escalations -- reads null on a wheel image,
#     because the version header is a devel-only file.
# Values on a classic /opt/rocm install are otherwise unchanged: every derived
# path resolves to the literal it replaced, and the Tensile fingerprint of a
# flat kernel directory is byte-identical.
# 1.14 -> 1.15 (recom-NaN follow-up: backend/Stream-K selectors, numeric-check
# knobs, TorchRec identity fixes). 1.14 already shipped in main (PR #308), so
# these changes to what a snapshot emits get their own version rather than
# silently redefining 1.14:
#   - ``CANONICAL_ENV_VARS`` is now GENERATED from the provenance manifest
#     ``aorta.instrumentation.env_knobs.ENV_KNOB_REGISTRY``, which records each
#     knob's library, consumer, category, source reference and reference build.
#     Capture is comprehensive and classification is recorded rather than used
#     as a filter: knobs whose only consumer is a print or a client-side report
#     (HIPBLASLT_LOG_*, HIPBLASLT_BENCH_*, {HIPBLASLT,TENSILE}_ENABLE_MARKER,
#     ROCBLAS_LAYER, ROCBLAS_LOG_*_PATH, ROCBLAS_VERBOSE_*_ERROR,
#     ANALYTICAL_GEMM_DEBUG, ORIGAMI_LOG_FILE, TENSILE_DB,
#     TENSILE_ADAPTIVE_GEMM_LOG, TENSILE_AUTO_GSU_ALGO,
#     TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_TRACE, TENSILE_BENCHMARK) are CAPTURED with
#     ``category="gemm_diagnostics"``,
#     where earlier 1.15 drafts excluded them. Recording a variable never
#     claims it affected execution -- it preserves the declared environment.
#     ``scripts/audit_env_knobs.py`` uses exact NUL-terminated strings: this
#     found five real non-prefixed Origami/GridBased getenv controls and rejects
#     the ``ROCBLAS_API_BENCH -f ...`` command template as non-environment data.
#   - More GEMM knobs: the coverage is decided by following each knob's
#     upstream getenv site to a call site, so the whole
#     behaviour-changing class is captured rather than a subset -- library and
#     ExtOp loading (HIPBLASLT_EXT_OP_LIBRARY_PATH, HIPBLASLT_PRELOAD_KERNELS),
#     backend routing (ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT_BATCHED,
#     ROCBLAS_TENSILE_GEMM_OVERRIDE_PATH), the numeric path
#     (ROCBLAS_INTERNAL_FORCE_VALU_FOR_DGEMM), allocator and workspace sizing
#     (ROCBLAS_DEVICE_MEMORY_SIZE,
#     ROCBLAS_INTERNAL_TRSM_REG_KERNEL_MEM_LIMIT), solution selection
#     (TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_METHOD, TENSILE_EXPERIMENTAL_SELECTION,
#     TENSILE_TAM_SELECTION_ENABLE, TENSILE_NAIVE_SEARCH, TENSILE_METRIC,
#     TENSILE_PREDICTION_LIB, TENSILE_GRIDBASED_{KDTREE,BATCH_EXP}), all seven
#     TENSILE_STREAMK_* knobs present in the library, workgroup mapping and
#     StaggerU (TENSILE_FIXED_WGM{,XCC,XCCCHUNK},
#     TENSILE_{DISABLE_STAGGERU,FIXED_STAGGERU,FIXED_STAGGERU_MAPPING,
#     FIXED_STAGGERU_STRIDE_SHIFT}), and TENSILE_DB2, whose low bits gate
#     skipKernelLaunch / skipInitKernelLaunch. TENSILE_STREAMK5_FORCE_MODE,
#     TENSILE_STREAMK_TILES and TENSILE_STREAMK_SPLIT are absent from the
#     1.4.0 .so and kept for forward-compatible diffing. Capture is independent
#     of library support: an exported value is preserved verbatim; null means
#     only that the process left the variable unset.
#   - HIPBLASLT_CHECK_NUMERICS[_SCAN_EVERY/_SCAN_FROM/_SCAN_UNTIL/
#     _STOP_ON_FIRST] and ROCBLAS_CHECK_NUMERICS are now CAPTURED. 1.14
#     wrongly classed them as behaviour-neutral logging: they launch extra
#     scan kernels and add synchronization, so they can hide or expose a
#     timing race even when the final arithmetic is unchanged. The rocBLAS
#     variant is the load-bearing one on the stock 1.4.0 image, where the
#     repro's GEMMs fall back to rocBLAS.
#   - ``torchrec.commit`` prefers the FULL 40-char build SHA read as TEXT from
#     the installed ``torchrec/version.py`` (``git_version``, written by
#     TorchRec's own setup.py). A release wheel such as "1.4.0" carries no SHA
#     in its version string, so 1.14 reported null even though the SHA was
#     sitting on disk. The version-string parse stays as the fallback, and now
#     also recognises TorchRec's source-build BARE-hex local segment
#     ("1.8.0a0+0123abc") -- guarded against setuptools_scm's dirty-tree
#     marker "+d<YYYYMMDD>" (all valid hex) so the build DATE is never
#     published as a commit SHA.
#   - A torchrec that is importable but lacks dist-info metadata (Buck /
#     PYTHONPATH link-tree) is resolved from ``version.py`` via
#     ``importlib.util.find_spec`` instead of being reported absent; only an
#     install with neither dist-info nor ``version.py`` records the
#     present-but-version-unknown partial reason. PEP 420 NAMESPACE packages
#     (a bare ``torchrec/`` directory anywhere on sys.path) are loader-less
#     and count as absent, so they can no longer flip a clean snapshot to
#     ``partial``.
#   - New ``torchrec`` keys ``source_version`` / ``source_commit`` /
#     ``distribution_version``: the import target's identity and the dist-info
#     identity are recorded SEPARATELY, because a Buck/PYTHONPATH-over-pip
#     process can resolve code from one install and metadata from another.
#     ``package_version`` / ``commit`` remain the primary identity and now
#     follow the IMPORT TARGET (what would actually run), with ``commit`` taken
#     from the same install as the version it accompanies. A disagreement is
#     reported in ``partial_reasons`` instead of being silently reconciled, and
#     versions are compared after PEP 440 normalisation so ``1.4.0-1`` and
#     ``1.4.0.post1`` are not a conflict. ``version.py`` is read THROUGH THE
#     LOADER, so a Buck ``.par`` (zipimport) resolves its identity instead of
#     reporting null; and only the package's own ``submodule_search_locations``
#     are consulted, so a single-module ``torchrec.py`` can no longer pick up an
#     unrelated sibling ``version.py``. ``find_spec`` and metadata errors are no
#     longer folded into "absent" -- each records its own reason, and a readable
#     ``version.py`` identity survives a metadata failure.
#   - ``summary()`` now shows a ``torchrec:`` line, matching its sibling
#     package blocks.
# 1.13 -> 1.14 (recsys-stack package identity + recom-NaN env vars):
#   - New top-level ``torchrec`` block ``{package_version, commit}``, always
#     present and defaulted so older snapshots / direct constructors remain
#     compatible. TorchRec is the core library of the MI350X recom-repro
#     workload (layered on the already-captured fbgemm); its version is
#     load-bearing for that escalation. Populated by ``_capture_torchrec()``.
#   - Expanded ``CANONICAL_ENV_VARS`` with the hipBLASLt/rocBLAS/Tensile GEMM
#     numeric + kernel-path knobs that flip which library / kernels / numeric
#     path actually run (HIPBLASLT_OVERRIDE_COMPUTE_TYPE_XF32, ROCBLAS_USE_
#     HIPBLASLT, {HIPBLASLT,ROCBLAS}_TENSILE_LIBPATH, HIPBLASLT_USE_ROCROLLER
#     [+NO_CUSTOM_KERNEL], HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE, ROCBLAS_DEFAULT_
#     ATOMICS_MODE, ROCBLAS_INTERNAL_FP16_ALT_IMPL[_RNZ], ROCBLAS_STREAM_
#     ORDER_ALLOC, TENSILE_SOLUTION_INDEX), plus HSA_TOOLS_DISABLE_REGISTER
#     and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (which .so actually loads). env_vars is an existing
#     dict field, so these are additive to its contents, not a new key.
# 1.12 -> 1.13 (Buck invocation-context provenance):
#   - New top-level ``buck_invocation`` block, always present and defaulted
#     via ``_empty_buck_invocation()``. It distinguishes ``not_requested``,
#     ``buck_not_detected``, ``success``, and ``failure``; records the target,
#     context source (``none`` / ``unspecified`` / ``default_confirmed`` /
#     ``explicit``), ordered mode files, ordered config KEYS (never values),
#     ordered modifiers, cross-option order, an aggregate SHA-256 over the
#     full ordered context values, the configured root target when cquery
#     exposes it, and the reserved comparison state ``not_compared``.
#   - ``collect_env(..., buck_context=BuckInvocationContext(...))`` forwards
#     mode/flag files, paired ``-c`` overrides, and paired ``-m`` modifiers to
#     the same bound ``buck2 cquery 'deps(%s)' <target> --json`` invocation.
#     The target is a query argument, never interpolated into query syntax.
#   - A target with no explicit context and no default-context confirmation
#     still runs, but records ``context_source="unspecified"`` plus a partial
#     reason. A target when ``build_system.kind != "buck2"`` also still runs
#     for backwards compatibility, but is visibly ``buck_not_detected`` and
#     partial rather than appearing plausible.
#   - This records client-side configured-graph invocation provenance only.
#     It does NOT populate ``execution_context.likely_execution_platform``,
#     answer the execution-marker/platform questions in the execution-context
#     design note, or prove where an action actually ran.
#
# 1.11 -> 1.12 (container & execution-context visibility, phase 2 -- namespace):
#   - New top-level ``probe_namespace`` (``str | None``). A mismatch-only
#     namespace observation derived from ``/proc/self/ns/mnt`` (primary)
#     or ``/proc/self/ns/cgroup`` (fallback), hashed with the per-boot
#     ``boot_id`` -> ``mnt:<sha256[:16]>`` / ``cgroup-ns:<sha256[:16]>``.
#     Different same-kind values prove that the observations came from
#     different boots/namespaces. Equality is advisory only: Linux can
#     recycle non-initial namespace inode numbers after namespace teardown.
#     When ``boot_id`` is unavailable, the token is still hashed and emitted
#     as ``mnt-local:`` / ``cgroup-ns-local:``; it is not cross-host
#     comparable. Missing boot identity, fallback use, and total capture
#     failure are recorded in ``partial_reasons``. Defaulted ``None`` +
#     ``from_dict()`` backfill so pre-1.12 snapshots round-trip. See
#     ``_capture_probe_namespace()``.
#
# 1.10 -> 1.11 (container & execution-context visibility, phase 1):
#   - New top-level ``container_detected`` (bool). A runtime-AGNOSTIC
#     isolation smoke test (``_detect_container_detected()``): True on any
#     generic sandbox signal -- a named runtime match, a private mount
#     namespace (``/proc/self/ns/mnt`` != ``/proc/1/ns/mnt``), or a
#     container/k8s token in ``/proc/self/cgroup``. Fixes the
#     RE-worker / k8s-pod false negative where ``runtime_context.type``
#     falls through to ``"baremetal"`` (it only knows docker/podman/
#     singularity). ``container_detected=True`` + ``type="baremetal"`` is
#     the honest reading of an unnamed sandbox. Defaulted ``False``.
#   - New top-level ``execution_context`` block (defaulted via
#     ``_empty_execution_context()``): ``probe_invocation`` (``direct`` /
#     ``buck2_run`` / ``buck2_action``, SELF-DECLARED via the new
#     ``aorta env probe --execution-context`` flag; ``direct`` by default)
#     and ``likely_execution_platform`` (reserved for phase-2 Buck2 work;
#     always ``None`` today). Additive: both fields use ``default_factory``
#     so <=1.10 snapshots round-trip via ``from_dict()``.
#   - See docs/env-probe-container-execution-context.md (design note). The
#     Buck2 / remote-execution pieces (likely_execution_platform,
#     $AORTA_RE_IMAGE, probe_namespace) remain phase-2 follow-ups.
#
# 1.9 -> 1.10 (host/container runtime split, part 1): KFD/AMDGPU
# kernel-mode-driver identity.
#   - New top-level ``amdgpu_driver`` block, always present (defaulted via
#     ``_empty_amdgpu_driver()``). HOST-KERNEL SCOPE for ``kfd_device_present``
#     / ``kfd_sysfs_present`` / ``kmd_version``: the amdgpu KMD and KFD live
#     in the host kernel a container shares, so these three fields report
#     the *host's* driver even from inside a container -- complementary to
#     ``rocm``/``hip`` which read the container's ``/opt/rocm`` userspace.
#     ``package_name`` / ``package_version`` / ``package_full_name`` /
#     ``package_manager`` and ``module_version`` / ``module_srcversion``
#     are NOT host-guaranteed: dpkg/rpm and ``modinfo`` read the *current
#     filesystem's* package DB and ``/lib/modules``, which is the
#     container's own view when probed from inside one, and will commonly
#     be null there even though the three host-kernel fields above are
#     populated. Fields: ``scope`` (constant ``"host_kernel"`` -- describes
#     the block's intent, not a per-field guarantee; see caveat above),
#     ``status`` (``"present"``/``"absent"``), ``package_name`` (stable
#     candidate family) / ``package_version`` / ``package_full_name``
#     (complete canonical identity -- apt ``name=version`` or rpm NVRA --
#     capturing kernel-suffixed names like
#     ``amdgpu-kmod-<kernel>-<driver-version>.<arch>`` that a bare candidate
#     name misses) / ``package_manager`` (portable, glob-capable
#     dpkg-then-rpm query over ``amdgpu-dkms`` / ``amdgpu-kmod``),
#     ``module_version`` / ``module_srcversion`` (``modinfo amdgpu``),
#     ``kmd_version`` (reused verbatim from ``rocm.kmd_version``),
#     ``kfd_device_present`` /
#     ``kfd_sysfs_present`` (``/dev/kfd`` + ``/sys/class/kfd`` existence).
#     A GPU-less host is a DOCUMENTED ABSENCE (``status="absent"``, no
#     ``partial``); only a KMD-loaded-but-unpackaged conflict records a
#     reason. Additive: ``EnvSnapshot.amdgpu_driver`` uses a
#     ``default_factory`` so a <=1.9 snapshot still round-trips via
#     ``from_dict``. 1.9 readers indexing ``amdgpu_driver`` on a pre-1.10
#     snapshot get the back-filled empty block.
#   - Compact catalog default: ``collect_env(detail="compact")`` (the
#     default) drops the per-file ``menu.files`` lists in
#     ``tensile_catalog`` / ``miopen_catalog`` (set to ``None``) -- they
#     dominated env.json size (~25k lines). All counts + the per-menu
#     ``combined_content_hash`` are kept, so a diff still detects a changed
#     catalog. ``detail="full"`` (CLI ``--extended``) retains the full
#     lists. NOT a schema-field change: the ``files`` key stays present as
#     ``None``, so ``from_dict`` and key-set readers are unaffected.
#   - Output-order regroup: ``to_dict()`` emits keys via a curated
#     ``_OUTPUT_KEY_ORDER`` (thematic grouping) instead of dataclass
#     declaration order. Key SET is unchanged; only ordering moved, so it
#     is not a compatibility-affecting change.
#
# 1.8 -> 1.9 (issue #54 + follow-ups): static kernel-catalog "recipe
# books" for the on-disk, runtime-selected GPU-compute catalogs.
#   - New top-level ``tensile_catalog`` block (issue #54), always present
#     (defaulted via ``_empty_tensile_catalog()``). A clearly-labeled
#     grouping of *installed-library identity* for the hipBLASLt/rocBLAS
#     Tensile install -- explicitly NOT the runtime-selected solution ID
#     (``381881`` / ``368xxx``), which requires a workload and is out of
#     scope for the no-compute probe. Reuses the existing
#     ``hipblaslt``/``rocblas``/``tensile`` captures for the version +
#     lib_hash + kernel-DB filename fingerprints (no regression) and
#     deepens them with a per-file ``menu`` enumeration of the frozen
#     solution library (``TensileLibrary`` / ``*.dat`` / ``*.yaml`` /
#     ``*.co`` / ``*.hsaco``): per-file content sha256 + size, a
#     ``logic_file_count``, ``gfx_arch_coverage``, and a
#     ``combined_content_hash``, so a two-host diff localizes *which*
#     logic file differs. Partial-not-silent: each ``menu`` carries
#     ``status`` + ``reason``; a dir that can't be located/listed is
#     ``partial`` (distinct from a present-but-empty menu, which is
#     ``ok`` with ``logic_file_count: 0``), and partial reasons thread
#     into ``partial_reasons``.
#   - New top-level ``miopen_catalog`` block (issue #54 follow-up). MIOpen
#     is the convolution analogue of Tensile; this mirrors
#     ``tensile_catalog`` for the databases under
#     ``/opt/rocm/share/miopen/db/``: reuses the ``miopen`` capture
#     (package_version / lib_hash / kernel_db_revision -- no regression)
#     and deepens it with a per-file ``menu`` enumeration of the
#     ``*.kdb`` / ``*.fdb.txt`` / ``*.db.txt`` / ``*.db`` selectable DBs
#     plus the ``*.ktn.model`` / ``*.tn.model`` heuristic tuning models.
#     Honors the ``MIOPEN_SYSTEM_DB_PATH`` override (records
#     ``db_dir`` / ``db_dir_source``) and surfaces ``MIOPEN_USER_DB_PATH``.
#   - New top-level ``rocfft_catalog`` block (issue #54 follow-up). rocFFT
#     compiles most kernels at runtime, so by default there is no frozen
#     catalog; this fingerprints the *optional* ahead-of-time
#     ``rocfft_kernel_cache.db`` when present (presence + path + size +
#     content sha256). Absence is the documented common case ->
#     ``status: "absent"`` with NO partial reason; present-but-unreadable
#     -> ``status: "partial"`` with a reason.
#   - All three are new top-level dataclass fields with default factories,
#     so 1.7/1.8 readers loading a 1.9 snapshot drop the unknown keys and
#     1.9 readers loading an older snapshot get the empty defaults.
#
# 1.7 -> 1.8 (Buck-target torch recovery + package commits):
#   - ``triton`` and ``fbgemm`` blocks each gained a ``commit`` key
#     (nested, additive). Best-effort git SHA parsed from a
#     setuptools_scm ``+g<sha>`` local-version segment, a ROCm/fb fork
#     ``.git<sha>`` segment, or a ``git_version`` / ``__commit__`` module
#     attribute. ``None`` when no commit is recoverable (e.g. fb wheels
#     versioned ``3.5.0+fb`` carry no SHA; fbgemm not separately
#     installed). Mirrors the existing ``aiter.commit`` field. 1.7
#     readers indexing ``triton["commit"]`` / ``fbgemm["commit"]`` on a
#     pre-1.8 snapshot get a KeyError -- guard with ``.get(...)``.
#   - No new top-level keys and no dataclass-field changes, so
#     ``EnvSnapshot.from_dict`` on a <=1.7 snapshot still round-trips.
#   - Behavioural (not schema-shape) change folded into this bump: the
#     ``libtorch_hip.so``-dependent probes (composable_kernel
#     pytorch_bundled symbol_count, aotriton bundled_*,
#     pytorch_build.binary_introspection symbol counts / torch_lib_bundled)
#     now locate torch's native lib dir via ``/proc/self/maps`` when
#     ``<torch>/lib`` is absent. This populates those previously-null
#     fields for Buck/monorepo torch targets (e.g. cell//ml:torch)
#     whose C++ runtime is dlopen'd from a build-artifact dir rather than
#     laid out under the Python package. No field shapes change.
#
# 1.6 -> 1.7 (issue #202, RCCL net-plugin + multi-vendor NIC stack):
#   - New top-level ``nics`` block keyed by vendor (``ainic``,
#     ``broadcom``, ``cx7``). Each entry has a Tier-0 ``present`` gate
#     (from ``lspci -d <vendor>:<device>``), Tier-1 sudo-free fields
#     (``driver_version``, ``firmware``, ``rdma_devices``, ``links``),
#     and -- AINIC only -- Tier-2 ``nicctl`` fields (``nicctl_version``,
#     ``card``, ``profile``, ``dcqcn``) gathered via ``sudo -n``.
#     A vendor that is absent from ``lspci`` is a DOCUMENTED ABSENCE
#     (``present: false``, no ``partial``); only an expected-but-failed
#     capture appends a reason. Additive: ``EnvSnapshot.nics`` uses
#     ``field(default_factory=dict)`` so ``from_dict`` on a <=1.6
#     snapshot still round-trips.
#   - The ``rccl`` block gained ``net_plugin_mode`` / ``plugin_path`` /
#     ``plugin_lib_hash`` / ``anp_lib_hash`` / ``net_lib_hash`` (nested
#     keys; no separate bump, folded into this one).
#
# 1.5 -> 1.6 (PR #187 review):
#   - Each ``library_introspection`` entry now carries TWO Buck-label
#     fields instead of one: ``target`` (canonical Buck label,
#     suitable for re-querying buck2; was previously the raw cquery
#     output) and ``configured_target`` (the raw cquery output
#     including the per-run configuration suffix
#     ``(prelude//platforms:default#<hash>)``). The motivation is
#     that the configuration hash changes between buck2 daemon
#     restarts even for the same source tree; storing only the
#     suffixed form (as A1.2b's first draft did, schema 1.4) made
#     env.json diffs unstable across repeat probes. ``target`` is
#     now the stable identifier; ``configured_target`` is kept for
#     forensics when reconciling two probes that diverged on the
#     same source. Backwards-compat: 1.5 readers loading a 1.6
#     snapshot see ``configured_target`` as an unknown nested key
#     and silently ignore it (entries are plain dicts, not dataclasses);
#     1.6 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot get entries without
#     ``configured_target`` and must guard with ``.get(...)`` if
#     they want it.
#
# 1.4 -> 1.5 (PR #177 / issue #176):
#   This entry collapses what was originally two separate version
#   bumps on the PR #177 branch (1.2 -> 1.3 source-introspection plus
#   1.3 -> 1.4 legacy-FindHIP fallback) because main shipped its own
#   1.3 and 1.4 in parallel (PR #164 / PR #165). All five additive
#   surfaces below are net-new on top of main's 1.4.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.cmake_cache`: parsed cmake cache entries
#     from `<source>/build/CMakeCache.txt` for source / editable
#     installs, filtered by an allowlist of name prefixes (USE_,
#     CK_, AITER_, FLASH_, HIPBLAS, ...). Wheel installs render
#     `entries: null` with no partial reason -- absence is the
#     documented common case.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.ninja_hipcc`: per-target HIPCC defines +
#     codegen flags + offload archs. Two parser strategies in one
#     block, discriminated by `_parser`:
#       * `"ninja_defines"` -- streamed parse of
#         `<source>/build/build.ninja` for the modern
#         `enable_language(HIP)` build shape. Identifies targets via
#         the `-D<target>_EXPORTS` token cmake appends per shared-lib
#         target.
#       * `"legacy_findhip_per_source"` -- fallback walk of
#         `<source>/build/**/<target>.dir/**/*.hip.o.cmake` driver
#         scripts when the ninja-only scan returns `targets: {}`
#         (common on ROCm/PyTorch Jenkins images that still use the
#         legacy `FindHIP.cmake` flow). Parses
#         `set(HIP_HIPCC_FLAGS …)` / `set(HIP_CLANG_FLAGS …)` cmake-
#         list values; `_legacy_scripts_scanned` reports the read
#         count.
#     Both parsers report the same per-target shape (`defines`,
#     `use_defines_present`, `codegen_flags_present`,
#     `offload_archs`). Targets reported: `torch_hip`, `torch_cpu`,
#     `c10_hip`, `ck_sdpa` (CK-backed SDPA backend; owns
#     USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA, CK_TILE_FMHA_*, FLASHATTENTION_DISABLE_* --
#     statically linked into libtorch_hip.so so its flags don't
#     appear in the wheel's host-side CXX_FLAGS), `mslk` (Multi-
#     Stream Layer Kernels). Wheel installs render `targets: null`.
#   - Added `aiter.hsa_tree`: per-arch fingerprint of aiter's pre-
#     compiled HSA `.co` kernel binaries (file_count, co_count,
#     deterministic combined_sha256 over sorted (relpath, sha256)
#     pairs). Searches importlib.util.find_spec("aiter_meta"), the
#     sibling aiter_meta dir, and $AORTA_PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/
#     aiter/hsa. Returns null when no tree is locatable -- silent
#     absence (most installs lack it).
#   - Added new top-level `pytorch_sdpa` block: runtime SDPA backend
#     state via torch.backends.cuda.{flash, mem_efficient, math,
#     cudnn}_sdp_enabled(). Per-backend null when the getter is
#     missing on older torch (distinguishable from True/False). Pre-
#     1.5 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot via EnvSnapshot.from_dict()
#     see this as an unknown top-level key and silently skip it
#     (from_dict's known-key filter rejects unknown keys). 1.5
#     readers loading a pre-1.5 snapshot get the dataclass-default
#     backends_enabled dict (all None) -- no TypeError.
#   Backwards-compat: every new nested key lives under existing top-
#   level dicts (or, for pytorch_sdpa, behind a dataclass default),
#   so 1.4 readers loading a 1.5 snapshot do NOT raise. Consumers
#   indexing the new nested keys (cmake_cache, ninja_hipcc, hsa_tree,
#   _parser, _legacy_scripts_scanned) directly on a 1.4 snapshot get
#   KeyError, not None -- use `.get(key)` or guard on schema_version.
#
# 1.3 -> 1.4 (issue #163 / A1.2b):
#   - Added top-level `library_introspection` (list[dict], default `[]`)
#     and `library_introspection_alternates` (list[dict], default `[]`).
#     Both always present. Populated only when collect_env() is called
#     with `buck_target=...` AND buck2 is functional; in that mode each
#     transitive dep label matched against
#     buck_introspect.KNOWN_LIBRARY_PATTERNS yields an entry of the
#     form ``{"name", "source": "buck", "revision", "target"}``
#     (schema 1.6 also adds ``"configured_target"``; see the 1.5 ->
#     1.6 history block above). When
#     a library matched via Buck is also captured by A1's existing
#     per-library blocks (hipblaslt, rocblas, ...), the A1-side
#     identifiers are synthesised into a parallel entry placed in
#     `library_introspection_alternates`. Outside buck mode both lists
#     are empty; A1's existing per-library top-level blocks remain
#     unchanged and authoritative.
#
# 1.2 -> 1.3 (issue #163 / A1.2a):
#   - Added top-level `build_system` block (always present). Populated
#     by aorta.instrumentation.build_system.detect_build_system(); the
#     value is `{"kind": "buck2", "buck2_version": str, "repo_root":
#     str, "revision": str | None}` when buck2 is on PATH AND both
#     `buck2 --version` and `buck2 root` succeed (i.e. we are
#     demonstrably inside a Buck checkout), or `{"kind": "none"}` in
#     every other case -- including the common "buck2 is installed
#     but cwd is not inside a Buck repo" branch where `buck2 root`
#     exits non-zero. The buck2 shape's `buck2_version` and
#     `repo_root` are guaranteed populated; only `revision` may be
#     None. Existing system-package / pkg-config / Docker-digest
#     blocks are unchanged.
#   - `EnvSnapshot.from_dict()` defaults a missing `build_system` key
#     to `{"kind": "none"}`, so a 1.3 reader can still load a 1.1 /
#     1.2 env.json. Mirrors the existing `partial_reasons` tolerance.
#
# 1.1 -> 1.2:
#   - Added `pytorch_build.flags` (build_settings, cxx_defines,
#     cxx_flags_raw, cuda_flags_raw, gpu_arch_list) -- structured raw
#     introspection from `torch.__config__.show()`.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.build_flags` (issue #170) -- stable 17-key
#     parsed bool/str/None subset projected from the structured flags
#     block; CAFFE2_USE_MIOPEN is treated as an alias for USE_MIOPEN.
#   - Added `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`
#     (libtorch_hip_symbol_counts, torch_lib_bundled,
#     cxx_flags_use_defines) -- pure-fact symbol counts and bundled-lib
#     presence from libtorch_hip.so via `nm | c++filt`.
#   - Extended `aiter` block: added `package_dist_name` (PyPI dist
#     identity, `amd_aiter` vs `aiter`) and `commit` (parsed from the
#     setuptools_scm `+g<sha>` local-version segment, matches the image
#     tag's `aiter-<sha>` label).
#   All additions are top-level-key-additive (every new field lives
#   under existing top-level dicts -- `pytorch_build`, `aiter` --
#   not as new top-level dataclass fields), so 1.1 readers running
#   `EnvSnapshot.from_dict(...)` against a 1.2 snapshot do NOT raise
#   and existing top-level access (`.pytorch_build`, `.aiter`) still
#   works. The new nested keys (`pytorch_build.flags`,
#   `pytorch_build.build_flags`, `pytorch_build.binary_introspection`,
#   `aiter.package_dist_name`, `aiter.commit`) are present on 1.2
#   snapshots and absent on 1.1 snapshots -- consumers indexing them
#   on a 1.1 snapshot get a KeyError, NOT None. Use `.get(key)` or
#   guard on `schema_version` if you read these.
#
# 1.0 -> 1.1:
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas/miopen.commit -> .rocm_release_tweak
#     (the field's value is the ROCm-release-shared identifier, not a
#     per-library upstream commit -- the old name misled consumers).
#   - Renamed hipblaslt/rocblas.tensile_yaml_revision -> .kernel_db_revision
#     (modern builds ship .dat not .yaml; matches miopen's naming).
#   - Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA from env_vars (it's a build-time cmake
#     flag, not a runtime env var). Replaced with `pytorch_use_ck_sdpa`
#     and `pytorch_use_ck_gemm` booleans inside the composable_kernel
#     block, parsed from `torch.__config__.show()` (same pattern as the
#     existing `fbgemm.pytorch_use_fbgemm*` fields).
#   - Added top-level `host`, `miopen`, `rccl`, `gpu_arch`, `aotriton`,
#     `pytorch_build`, `composable_kernel`, `tensile`, `triton`,
#     `fbgemm`, `aiter`, `rocblas` blocks. All purely additive.
#   - Expanded CANONICAL_ENV_VARS across GPU scoping
#     (HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES / ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES /
#     HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION), launch (HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING), build
#     target (PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH), MIOpen kernel-DB selection
#     (MIOPEN_SYSTEM_DB_PATH / MIOPEN_USER_DB_PATH /
#     MIOPEN_DEBUG_DISABLE_FIND_DB / MIOPEN_FIND_MODE), SDPA backend
#     (TORCH_ROCM_FA_PREFER_CK / TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL),
#     hipBLASLt autotune (TORCH_BLAS_PREFER_HIPBLASLT /
#     TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE / TORCH_HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE),
#     and NCCL/RCCL extras (NCCL_P2P_LEVEL / NCCL_IB_HCA /
#     NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME / RCCL_MSCCL_ENABLE). Removed USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA
#     (build-time cmake flag, see above). See CANONICAL_ENV_VARS for
#     the full set.
#   - host.glibc_version no longer carries the redundant "glibc "
#     prefix; the value is the bare version string (e.g. "2.35").

# rocFFT optional ahead-of-time kernel cache (issue #54 follow-up).
# rocFFT compiles most kernels at runtime (RTC); an offline-built cache
# is an opt-in SQLite file. Per rocFFT's runtime-compilation design
# (rtc_cache.cpp), there are TWO distinct cache paths and only one is
# "installed identity":
#   * ROCFFT_RTC_SYS_CACHE_PATH -- the pre-built, READ-ONLY system cache
#     override. This is the installed artifact this catalog fingerprints.
#   * ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH -- the READ-WRITE, per-process user cache,
#     populated on demand at runtime. NOT installed-library identity --
#     its contents are workload-dependent and not reproducible across
#     runs, so it must not be fingerprinted as a static catalog. We only
#     record its configured value (env_overrides) for visibility.
# Default (no override) search order mirrors rtc_cache.cpp:
# ``{librocfft.so dir}/rocfft_kernel_cache.db`` then
# ``{librocfft.so dir}/rocfft/rocfft_kernel_cache.db``. Absence is normal

    1. **Settings pass** -- check every alias of the canonical name in

    2. **Defines pass** -- only if the settings pass found nothing,
       check every alias in ``CXX_FLAGS`` ``-D<NAME>[=<value>]``
       defines. A bare ``-D<NAME>`` (no value) renders as ``True``

    """Wraps the env.json schema as a typed object.

    Attributes mirror the env.json keys 1-to-1; ``to_dict()`` / ``from_dict()``
    round-trip losslessly. The dataclass is ``frozen=True``, which prevents
    *attribute rebinding* on the snapshot itself (``snap.rocm = ...`` raises),
    but it does NOT deep-freeze the nested ``dict`` / ``list`` containers --
    callers can still mutate ``snap.rocm["version"] = ...`` or
    ``snap.partial_reasons.append(...)`` in place. Treat embedded snapshots
    as read-only; if you need to modify, deep-copy first via
    ``EnvSnapshot.from_dict(copy.deepcopy(snap.to_dict()))``.

    The two fail-soft fields make the snapshot honest about partial captures:

    * ``partial`` -- True if at least one probe fell back to None when it was
      expected to populate. False on a clean probe.
    * ``partial_reasons`` -- one human-readable string per fallback. The list
      is empty when ``partial`` is False. Each entry names the field plus a
      short cause (e.g. ``"system_health: rdhc not on PATH"``).

    "Documented absences" do NOT trigger partial:

    * ``docker == None`` on baremetal (no container, nothing to record)
    * ``env_vars[X] == None`` for an unset env var (the documented contract)
    * ``runtime_context.venv_path == None`` outside a venv

    * ``pytorch_version == None`` (torch not installed)

    ``collect_env`` imports torch in-process to read versions / scan kernels
    (``_capture_pytorch_version`` and the other torch-touching probes). On a
    multi-GPU ROCm host the in-process HIP runtime ``dlopen`` performs a
    device-topology enumeration that writes one benign
    ``(null): No such file or directory`` line per GPU **directly to file
    descriptor 2** (a C-runtime ``perror`` with a NULL program name), plus
    occasional toolchain chatter on fd 1. Because the probe runs in the
    long-lived ``aorta`` parent process, that noise lands on the operator's
    terminal and looks like a fatal workload error (#220).

    ``contextlib.redirect_stderr`` cannot intercept this -- it only swaps the
    Python ``sys.stderr`` object and never moves the real fd 2 -- so we
    ``dup2`` fds 1/2 onto a temp file for the probe and re-emit any captured
    bytes at DEBUG level afterwards.

    Fail-soft, matching ``collect_env``'s never-raises contract: if the real
    descriptors can't be duplicated (already closed / detached), the probe
    runs unredirected rather than risk losing the snapshot. ``stop`` is
    idempotent so the caller can restore early (before disaster logging) and
    still rely on a ``finally`` safety net.

    """Capture the current process environment as an :class:`EnvSnapshot`.

    NEVER raises. The promise is enforced two ways:

    * Every probe is individually fail-soft (returns None or a shaped
      dict; appends a human-readable reason to a shared list on fallback).
    * The orchestrator body is wrapped in a top-level ``try / except
      Exception``. If anything genuinely unexpected raises (a stdlib call
      misbehaves, a probe is buggy, etc.), the disaster-recovery helper
      :func:`_disaster_snapshot` constructs a minimally-shaped
      :class:`EnvSnapshot` with ``partial=True`` and the original
      exception captured in ``partial_reasons``. Callers (B1 dispatcher,
      B2 matrix runner, CLI) always get back a valid object.

    No GPU compute. No tensor allocations. The optional ``import torch``
    for the version probe does NOT initialise CUDA / HIP context.

    Buck mode (``buck_target=...``) opts into the A1.2b path: the
    function additionally runs a bound
    ``buck2 cquery 'deps(%s)' <target> --json``,
    matches transitive deps against
    ``buck_introspect.KNOWN_LIBRARY_PATTERNS``, and populates
    ``library_introspection`` (plus ``library_introspection_alternates``
    when an A1 per-library block also captured the same name). Each
    ``library_introspection`` entry carries both a canonical
    ``target`` (stripped Buck label, stable across daemon restarts)
    and a ``configured_target`` (raw cquery output including the
    per-run configuration suffix) per schema 1.6. Outside buck mode
    both lists stay empty and the existing per-library top-level
    blocks remain authoritative. ``buck_timeout`` caps the cquery
    subprocess (seconds; default 10). ``buck_context`` supplies only typed,
    ordered Buck inputs (mode/flag files, config overrides, modifiers, or
    explicit default-context confirmation); there is no shell-string
    passthrough. Config values reach Buck and the aggregate fingerprint but
    are never persisted in ``buck_invocation``.

    ``detail`` controls the size of the static kernel-catalog blocks:

    * ``"compact"`` (default) -- the ``tensile_catalog`` / ``miopen_catalog``
      per-file ``menu.files`` lists are dropped (set to ``None``). These
      lists are the dominant source of env.json size (thousands of entries
      on a populated host -> ~25k JSON lines). Every summary/fingerprint
      field is kept -- ``status``, ``dir``, ``file_count``,
      ``logic_file_count``, ``gfx_arch_coverage``, ``combined_content_hash``
      -- so a two-host diff still detects THAT a catalog differs. This is
      the right default for the per-trial artifact.
    * ``"full"`` -- retains the complete per-file lists for forensic
      follow-up (localizing exactly WHICH recipe/db file changed). Selected
      by ``aorta env probe --extended``.

    Any other value is treated as ``"compact"``. Note the files are hashed
    either way (``combined_content_hash`` requires it); ``detail`` only
    controls whether the per-file breakdown is retained in the snapshot.

    snapshot from a ``buck2_action`` run must not silently rewrite itself
    to ``"direct"``, which would misdirect triage. An unrecognized value
    falls back to ``"direct"`` (same rule as the happy path).

    ``buck_target`` / ``buck_context`` likewise preserve a requested Buck
    invocation as ``status="failure"`` with redacted context metadata. A
    crash must not rewrite a requested query as ``not_requested``.

    ``probe_namespace`` is preserved when the happy path captured it before
    a later helper failed. When capture was never reached, the disaster path
    makes one guarded best-effort attempt instead.

    Used by the never-raises top-level guard. Every field gets a sane
    null/empty default so downstream consumers (B1, B2, jq pipelines)
    still see the schema they expect, with ``partial=True`` and the
    triggering exception in ``partial_reasons``.

    Even helpers used here are guarded -- if ``_utc_now_iso`` or

    Goal: catch GEMM kernel library drift across docker images / conda
    envs / venvs. See issue #147 motivation.

    ``upstream_commit`` (schema 1.16, issue #381) carries the full 40-char
    ``rocm-libraries`` pin from TheRock's manifest when one is present. It
    matters most on a wheel-layout install, where the version header is a
    devel-only file that runtime images do not ship: without it the
    hipBLASLt provenance -- core evidence in the NaN escalations -- would
    read ``null`` there. ``None`` on a classic install is expected, not a
    fallback: that layout has no manifest and the header supplies identity.

    NOTE on ``rocm_release_tweak`` vs ``commit``: AMD sets
    ``HIPBLASLT_VERSION_TWEAK`` to the **ROCm release identifier**, not
    to hipBLASLt's upstream git SHA. In a given ROCm release every
    library shares the same TWEAK -- so this field is the right name
    for "which ROCm release built this library", not "which upstream
    hipBLASLt commit". For per-library upstream SHA tracking, see
    ``lib_hash`` (changes any time the binary changes) and the
    ``applied_prs`` slot (filled in when a specific PR detector lands).

    The ``applied_prs`` block is intentionally empty in this first cut.
    Adding ``pr_<id>_applied`` keys later is additive and does not bump
    ``schema_version``. Each PR detector needs a unique signature
    (symbol via ``nm``, string via ``strings``, or Tensile YAML revision
    bump) -- those will land in a follow-up alongside the first PR we
    care to track.

    * **flat** -- every kernel file directly in ``<lib>/hipblaslt/library/``.
      Verified on ROCm 5.x / 6.x / 7.x classic installs (2932 entries on

      what the TheRock wheel layout ships (629 entries under ``gfx950`` on
      7.15.0a20260716, with the parent holding nothing but that directory).
      Files found there are recorded as ``<arch>/<filename>`` so the same
      kernel appearing under two targets stays distinguishable.

    Recursion is deliberately limited to one level of ``gfx*``-named
    directories rather than a blanket ``rglob``: packagers drop unrelated
    cache files alongside a kernel DB, and hashing those would make the
    fingerprint drift for reasons that have nothing to do with the kernels.

    Generic engine behind every ``*_catalog`` menu (Tensile, MIOpen,
    ...). Deepens a filename-only fingerprint: opens each matched file
    and records a **content** sha256 + size, so a two-host diff localizes
    *which* file changed rather than only "the filename set differs".
    Still no GPU compute -- pure file reads in the install.

    ``include_files`` controls only whether the per-file ``files`` list is
    RETAINED in the returned menu, not whether the work happens: every
    file is still hashed either way, because ``combined_content_hash``,
    ``file_count``, ``logic_file_count``, and ``gfx_arch_coverage`` are all
    derived from that pass. In compact mode (``include_files=False``) the
    per-file list -- the dominant source of env.json bloat, thousands of
    entries on a populated host -- is dropped to ``None`` while every
    summary/fingerprint field is preserved, so a two-host diff still
    detects THAT a catalog changed via ``combined_content_hash`` (only
    localizing WHICH file needs ``--extended``).

    ``classify(filename) -> (include: bool, suffix_label: str | None,
    is_logic: bool)`` selects which files belong to the catalog, labels
    each file's (possibly multi-part) suffix, and flags whether it is one
    of the runtime-selectable databases (counted as ``logic_file_count``)
    vs. a supporting blob (code object, heuristic model). ``kind`` is a
    short noun used in the partial reasons (e.g. ``"Tensile library"``).

    Returns the shared ``menu`` shape (see ``_empty_menu``). Partial-not-
    silent contract: a dir that can't be located/listed yields
    ``status="partial"`` with a ``reason`` -- distinct from a present-but-
    empty dir, which is ``status="ok"`` with ``logic_file_count=0`` (a
    host that genuinely ships an empty catalog). A per-file hash that
    fails (unreadable file) is recorded with ``sha256=None`` and
    downgrades the block to ``partial`` rather than dropping the file.

    Classification happens by filename first, before any ``stat()``.
    A name that ``classify()`` says belongs to the catalog is never
    silently skipped just because ``is_dir()``/``is_file()`` raised
    (e.g. a broken symlink, or a permission-denied entry): it is kept
    as an entry so the hashing step below fails soft (``sha256=None``)
    and correctly downgrades the block to ``partial`` with a reason,
    instead of vanishing from ``files`` and leaving a clean ``status:
    "ok"`` that silently omitted it. Only entries confirmed (not merely

def _capture_torchrec(reasons: list[str]) -> dict[str, str | None]:
    """Capture TorchRec package version + best-effort build commit.

    TorchRec is the sharded-embedding / training-pipeline library layered on
    top of fbgemm (already captured separately) and is the core library of
    the MI350X recom-repro workload, so pinning its version matters for that
    escalation.

    Deliberately uses ``find_spec`` plus distribution metadata rather than
    importing torchrec the way ``_capture_triton`` imports triton: importing
    torchrec eagerly pulls in torch + fbgemm and calls
    ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` once on import (measured on ROCm 7.0.2).
    The probe holds the stricter contract that it never calls into
    ``torch.cuda`` at all; both identity lookups are side-effect-free.

    TWO IDENTITIES, RECORDED SEPARATELY (schema 1.15). ``find_spec`` and
    ``importlib.metadata`` answer different questions, and in a Buck /
    PYTHONPATH-over-pip deployment they can disagree:

    * ``source_version`` / ``source_commit`` describe the code Python would
      actually import -- read from ``version.py`` inside the resolved import
      target (see ``_torchrec_source_identity``).
    * ``distribution_version`` is what a ``*.dist-info`` on ``sys.path``
      claims, which may belong to a DIFFERENT copy of torchrec.
    * ``package_version`` / ``commit`` stay the primary identity for
      consumers that want one answer. They follow the IMPORT TARGET, because
      a snapshot should describe what would run; ``commit`` then comes from
      the same install its version did, never from the other one's metadata.

    When the two disagree, the conflict is recorded in ``partial_reasons``
    rather than smoothed over -- an operator diffing two snapshots needs to
    know the process had two torchrecs on its path. Versions are compared
    after PEP 440 normalisation (``_same_distribution_version``) so
    equivalent spellings like ``1.4.0-1`` and ``1.4.0.post1`` are not reported
    as a conflict.

    ``find_spec`` locates the package via the meta-path finders WITHOUT
    executing ``torchrec/__init__.py`` (torchrec is top-level, so no parent
    package is imported either), and it hands back the package's search
    locations, which is what makes the ``version.py`` read possible under the
    same no-import contract. That file is the authoritative source for
    ``commit``: it carries the FULL 40-char build SHA even for release wheels,
    whose version string carries none. The version-string parse
    (``_torchrec_commit``) is the fallback for installs built without setup.py.

    A PEP 420 NAMESPACE package -- any bare directory named ``torchrec`` on
    ``sys.path`` -- is not an executable TorchRec install, so it counts as
    absent. Detection accepts the two real namespace loader states (``None``
    before import, ``NamespaceLoader`` after import) together with
    ``origin is None`` and search locations; an originless custom/Buck loader
    remains an executable import target. A namespace portion never wins over a
    real install regardless of sys.path order: the path finder yields one only
    when no real package exists.

    Absence handling, so a Buck / PYTHONPATH deployment is not falsely
    reported absent (``PackageNotFoundError`` means *no dist-info metadata*,
    NOT *not importable* -- a monorepo link-tree can expose an importable
    torchrec with no ``*.dist-info``):

    * metadata missing AND not importable: the documented common case
      (non-recsys installs lack it) -> NO partial reason, mirroring the
      fbgemm_gpu / aiter ``suppress_missing`` contract.
    * metadata missing BUT importable with a readable ``version.py``: report
      that version and commit, no partial reason -- the same self-declared
      identity ``_capture_triton`` publishes for triton.
    * importable but no readable source version: promote distribution metadata
      only when that distribution's ``RECORD`` owns the resolved package/module.
      Otherwise retain its version and any source commit separately, leave the
      primary identity unknown, and record a partial reason.
    * metadata present but no importable non-namespace target: retain it only
      as ``distribution_version`` and record a partial reason.
    * either lookup RAISING is never folded into "absent": ``find_spec``
      failing on a broken ``sys.path`` and a metadata read failing each record
      their own reason, and a readable ``version.py`` identity survives a
      metadata failure.

    """Per-arch fingerprint of aiter's pre-compiled HSA code-object tree.

    aiter ships pre-built GCN/CDNA assembly blobs (``.co`` files = HSA
    code objects, one per ``(gfx target, kernel shape, dtype, rounding,
    masking, ...)`` tuple) under ``hsa/<gfx>/...``. The C++ dispatch
    code (``mha_bwd.hip`` etc.) selects which ``.co`` to load via
    ``hipModuleLoad`` at runtime; the kernel binaries themselves are
    NOT compiled from the wheel's HIPCC flags. Two images can share
    identical compile-time aiter SHAs but ship different ``.co`` bytes
    (or vice versa), and either drift can change numerics.

    Per arch we report:

    * ``file_count`` -- number of regular files under the arch dir
      (``.co`` plus any sidecars). Mismatch alone is a strong drift
      signal.
    * ``co_count`` -- subset that are ``.co`` files.
    * ``combined_sha256`` -- sha256 over the sorted ``(relpath,
      sha256)`` pairs. Stable across hash-equal trees regardless of
      mtime / inode order.

    Three search roots, each independently reported (an image can ship
    both a pip dist tree and a vendored source-tree copy):

    1. ``importlib.util.find_spec("aiter_meta")`` -> ``<spec>/hsa/<gfx>/``
       (the pip-installed dist's code-object location -- ``aiter_meta``
       is a separate distribution from the import package ``aiter``).
    2. ``<aiter_pkg>/../aiter_meta/hsa/<gfx>/`` (some layouts).
    3. ``$AORTA_PYTORCH_SRC/third_party/aiter/hsa/<gfx>/`` when the
       env var is set (mirrors the AORTA_PYTORCH_SRC convention used
       by the submodule probe).

      The actionable subset of ``cxx_flags_raw``.
    * ``cxx_flags_raw`` / ``cuda_flags_raw`` -- the verbatim flag
      strings, preserved for grep over non-define args

    * ``gpu_arch_list`` -- ``torch.cuda.get_arch_list()`` output.

    Limitation: ``torch.__config__.show()`` reports only host-side C++
    flags. PyTorch's ATen-hip target applies many additional defines
    *only* when invoking HIPCC on .hip files (CK_TILE_FMHA_FWD_FAST_EXP2,
    AITER_ASM_DIR, HIPBLASLT_HAS_GETINDEXFROMALGO, HIPBLAS_V2,
    USE_FLASH_ATTENTION on some builds, the various warning
    suppressions, ...). Those are NOT recoverable from a wheel install
    -- they live in the build's ``compile_commands.json`` which is not
    shipped. For source/editable installs they could be read via the
    cmake-generated commands DB, but that path is out of scope for this
    probe (the env-probe runtime budget is ~5 s and parsing
    compile_commands.json alone costs more than that).

    The authoritative source for what HIPCC actually compiled the .hip
    files with. ``torch.__config__.show()`` only exposes the host-side
    ``CXX_FLAGS``; the per-target HIPCC flags (``USE_ROCM_CK_SDPA``,
    ``DISABLE_AOTRITON``, ``CK_TILE_FMHA_FWD_FAST_EXP2``,
    ``-fgpu-flush-denormals-to-zero``, ...) live ONLY in build.ninja's
    per-rule ``DEFINES = ...`` and ``FLAGS = ...`` blocks.

    cmake's ninja generator emits the same DEFINES line for every
    source file in a target, so build.ninja typically has thousands of
    identical DEFINES lines collapsing to ~50 unique blocks. Each
    block is identified by the ``-D<target>_EXPORTS`` token cmake
    appends per shared-lib target (``torch_hip_EXPORTS``,
    ``c10_hip_EXPORTS``, ...).

    Captured per target in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_TARGETS_OF_INTEREST`:

    * ``defines`` -- sorted dict of every ``-D`` define passed to that
      target (name -> value or ``None``).
    * ``use_defines_present`` -- yes/no map for the customer-relevant
      flags in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_FLAGS_OF_INTEREST`. Fast diff key.
    * ``codegen_flags_present`` -- yes/no map for the FP / denormal
      codegen flags in :data:`_NINJA_HIPCC_CODEGEN_FLAGS_OF_INTEREST`.
    * ``offload_archs`` -- sorted list of ``--offload-arch=`` values
      observed in the target's FLAGS line.

    Returns ``targets: None`` for wheel installs (build.ninja absent).
    When build.ninja exists but no targets-of-interest matched in the
    ninja-only scan, the function falls back to
    :func:`_capture_pytorch_legacy_findhip`, which walks per-source
    ``*.hip.o.cmake`` driver scripts emitted by the legacy
    ``FindHIP.cmake`` build path. If that fallback finds nothing
    either, returns ``_source_file`` populated and ``targets: {}`` --
    distinguishable from the wheel/no-file case so consumers know we
    DID scan.

    Two additive keys discriminate which parser produced the result:

    * ``_parser`` -- ``"ninja_defines"`` (modern ``enable_language(HIP)``
      shape) or ``"legacy_findhip_per_source"`` (the per-source cmake
      script fallback) or ``None`` (no parse attempted / both failed).
    * ``_legacy_scripts_scanned`` -- int count of ``*.hip.o.cmake``
      files read when the fallback fired; ``None`` otherwise.

    Streams the file line-by-line: build.ninja can be 350+ MB on a
    fully-built tree so we must not slurp. Long Ninja variable
    assignments use ``$\\n`` continuation; the inner generator folds
    those before the regex pass so a DEFINES that wraps onto follow-on

      ``dkms_status`` blob, which is null on hosts without rdhc set

      the build-id flavour, distinguishes patched kernels at the same
      release tag.
    * ``machine`` (``"x86_64"`` / ``"aarch64"``): basic but matters
      when the same source tree gets built for multiple targets.

      compiled against a newer glibc fail to load on older hosts. The

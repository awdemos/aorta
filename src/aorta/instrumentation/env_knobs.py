"""Provenance manifest for every environment variable ``aorta env probe`` captures.

``CANONICAL_ENV_VARS`` -- the list the probe reads -- is GENERATED from
``ENV_KNOB_REGISTRY`` below, so the captured set, its classification and its provenance
cannot drift apart. Adding a knob means adding one registry entry; the tests, the docs
table and the coverage audit all read the same manifest.

What a registry entry asserts, and what it does not
--------------------------------------------------
An entry records that a variable is worth *preserving* in a snapshot and what is known
about who reads it. It makes no claim that the installed library supports the variable,
that the process exported it, or that it affected a run. ``_capture_env_vars`` is
``os.environ.get`` over these names: a ``null`` value means the variable was **unset in
this process**, never "unsupported by the library".

* ``library``          -- the component the variable belongs to. For a GEMM-prefix knob
  that is PRESENT in the reference build this is MEASURED: it is the shipped shared
  object whose string table holds the name, per ``scripts/audit_env_knobs.py``. A string
  table shows the name, not a call site, so this is ownership rather than proof of
  consumption -- ``consumer`` carries whatever was actually traced. Knobs marked
  ``ABSENT_FROM_REFERENCE_BUILD`` are declared, not measured: the audit has no binary to
  compare them against.
* ``consumer``         -- what the value reaches, at the granularity that was actually
  verified. For ``category="gemm_diagnostics"`` knobs the verified answer is "log or
  report emission only"; that classification is *recorded*, and is deliberately NOT used
  to exclude the knob from capture.
* ``category``         -- classification, from ``CATEGORIES``.
* ``source_reference`` -- where the entry can be re-verified. For GEMM knobs that is the
  reference build's library, re-checkable by running the audit script. Entries inherited
  from schema <= 1.14 are marked ``INHERITED_UNAUDITED`` rather than given a source they
  were never traced to.
* ``reference_build``  -- the build ``source_reference`` speaks about, since each ROCm
  release ships a different subset.

Auditing coverage
-----------------
``scripts/audit_env_knobs.py`` diffs this registry against the env-var strings in the
installed hipBLASLt / rocBLAS libraries and reports three sets: covered,
not-present-here (fine -- support varies by build; capture still depends only on whether
the process exported the variable), and *uncovered* -- a knob the library exposes that
this registry omits. That direction is the one a hand-written second list cannot check.

"""Recipe schema, loader, and flag-mode builder for `aorta triage run`.

The recipe is the authoritative description of a triage matrix invocation:
which cells to run (cartesian or hand-picked mitigation x environment pairs),
per-cell trial / step counts, the ticket the matrix belongs to, and the
speed-confound detection config.

Two entry points converge on the same `Recipe` dataclass:

* :func:`load_recipe` - parses a YAML or JSON recipe file.
* :func:`build_recipe_from_flags` - constructs an in-memory `Recipe` from the
  CLI flag shim (``aorta triage run --mode matrix --mitigation-axis ... --environment-axis ...``).

The runner consumes a validated `Recipe` and does not branch on the origin
of it - both paths produce the same structure.

Schema version: 1. Unknown ``schema_version`` values raise
:class:`RecipeSchemaError` with a clear message.

            (so this cell can override a registered mitigation for one-off
            experiments without polluting the registry). ``extra_env`` overrides

            disagreements are flagged as errors.

    consumed by the runner. A ``Recipe`` is only constructed after all
    name-resolution, schema validation, and inline-docker normalization has
    succeeded, so downstream code can assume every cell references a name
    that will resolve at runtime.

    Attributes:
        schema_version: Always ``1`` for this build.
        workload: Workload name (resolved via ``aorta.workloads`` entry-point
            group at runtime by B1).
        trials: Recipe-level trial count. Cells override via ``cell.trials``.
        steps: Recipe-level step count. Cells override via ``cell.steps``.
        cells: Tuple of :class:`Cell` rows, in the order they appear in the
            source (preserved for matrix.md row ordering).
        ticket: Optional ticket ID; drives output-dir grouping. ``None`` is
            routed to ``_no_ticket_`` at write time.
        confound: Speed-confound detection configuration.
        inline_environments: Auto-registered inline envs referenced by cells.
            The runner writes a temporary sidecar JSON containing these so
            B1's ``get_environment`` resolves the auto-names.
        sidecar_files: Operator-supplied ``--mitigations-file`` paths that
            were used to validate this recipe's names. Carried on the
            ``Recipe`` so a programmatic ``load_recipe(path,
            sidecar_files=...) -> run_recipe(recipe)`` flow works without
            the caller threading sidecars through twice. The runner unions
            this with its own ``extra_sidecar_files`` argument and also
            snapshots each path into ``<run_dir>/sidecars/<basename>`` for
            replay. Empty tuple when no sidecars were supplied.
        source_path: Path of the source file if loaded from disk (None for
            flag-mode). Surfaced in ``matrix.md``.
        source_sha256: SHA-256 of the source file text (None for flag-mode).
            Surfaced in ``matrix.md`` for reproducibility.
        workload_config: Recipe-scope ``dict[str, Any]`` applied to every
            cell as the base ``Request.config_overrides``. Per-cell
            ``Cell.workload_config`` merges over this on a per-key basis
            (cell wins on collision; non-collision keys union). Empty dict
            when the recipe omits the field -- behaviourally identical to
            today's recipes.
        save_logs: When ``True``, the dispatcher captures the workload's
            in-process ``stdout`` / ``stderr`` writes (via
            ``contextlib.redirect_*``) into per-trial files alongside the
            trial JSON. Default ``False`` preserves today's behaviour
            (writes are not captured -- they appear on the parent
            process's TTY). Workloads that spawn subprocesses don't have
            their subprocess output captured by ``redirect_*``; those
            wrappers can opt in by reading the platform-supplied
            ``_aorta_save_logs`` / ``_aorta_log_prefix`` config keys
            the dispatcher injects and writing their own capture to a
            sibling path derived from the prefix (e.g.
            ``<prefix>.subprocess.stdout.log``). The prefix is an
            absolute path-with-stem so wrappers don't need to know
            ``results_dir``. Both file capture and key injection are
            **rank-0 only** -- matches the trial-JSON write guarantee.
            Wrappers running on non-rank-0 won't see the keys and
            should treat capture as off there.
        collect: Collector recipe names attached to every cell (e.g.
            ``("layer_numerics",)``). Cross-cutting capture, not a matrix
            axis -- the same collectors run in every cell. Forwarded to each
            cell's ``RunRequest.collect``; the dispatcher validates them
            against ``KNOWN_RECIPES`` and threads them into
            ``config['_aorta_collect']`` for the workload to act on. Empty
            tuple (default) means no collector -- identical to today's
            recipes. Set via the recipe ``collect:`` key (list or mapping
            form) or the ``--collect`` CLI flag (names only).
        collect_options: Per-collector knobs from the mapping form of
            ``collect:`` (e.g. ``{"layer_numerics": {"NANLOG_SAMPLE_EVERY":
            "1"}}``). Only collectors given a non-empty option dict appear.

    """Construct an in-memory :class:`Recipe` from the CLI flag shim.

    The flag shim builds the full cartesian product of
    ``mitigation_axis x environment_axis``, naming each cell
    ``<mitigation>-<environment>``. The runner does not branch on mode after
    this point -- both the recipe path and the flag path funnel into
    :func:`aorta.triage.runner.run_recipe`.

    Environment-axis item parsing (Option B from the spec):

    * ``image:<ref>`` -> inline-docker cell using the same ``{docker: <ref>}``
      normalisation as recipe-mode. Cell name embeds the auto-name so
      ``<mitigation>-_inline_<hash>`` disambiguates multiple images on the
      same axis.
    * Anything else -> registered environment name (resolved against the
      registry at validation time).

    Every primitive is validated up-front to the same standard as
    :func:`load_recipe` (positive trials/steps, non-empty workload, sane
    confound threshold) so flag mode and recipe mode reject the same set of
    invalid inputs.

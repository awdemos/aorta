"""Reserved platform-internal workload wrapping an opaque user subprocess.

Wired into the ``aorta.workloads`` entry-point group as the leading-
underscored name ``_subprocess`` so it cannot collide with any user-
facing workload name. Consumed by ``aorta probe`` (issue #188) to wrap
arbitrary launch commands -- ``bash launch.sh``, ``torchrun ...``,
``buck2 run //path:target -- ...``, ``docker run ...`` -- without
parsing or modifying the user's argv.

The argv is delivered as a reserved config key, ``_aorta_subprocess_argv``,
injected by :class:`aorta.run.dispatcher.RunRequest` after
``config_overrides`` is merged. The reserved-prefix block at the top of
``run_trials`` rejects any user-supplied ``_aorta_*`` key, so users
cannot smuggle an argv via ``config_overrides`` -- the typed
``RunRequest.subprocess_argv`` field is the only legal channel.

Per-trial output layout (Phase 1):

* ``<cell_dir>/trial_<N>/stdout.log`` -- captured stdout written as
  RAW BYTES (the file handle is opened in binary ``"wb"`` mode so the
  child process's output lands on disk byte-for-byte; no decode,
  encoding-error handling, or line buffering is performed in the
  parent). Downstream readers should treat the file as bytes and
  decode lazily.
* ``<cell_dir>/trial_<N>/stderr.log`` -- captured stderr, same raw-
  bytes contract as stdout.log.
* ``<cell_dir>/trial_<N>/result.json`` -- Tier-1 verdict + metadata.
* ``<cell_dir>/trial_<N>/probe.env`` -- only when
  ``env_passthrough_mode == "file"`` (chmod 0600).

Verdict (Phase 2): the five-tier classifier in
:mod:`aorta.probe.classifier` runs post-exit. A trial whose process
exit is non-zero, timed out, hung, hit a dmesg / amd-smi signal, hit
a built-in Tier-4 pattern, or hit a user ``custom_patterns`` entry
with ``on_match: fail`` resolves to ``"fail"``; otherwise ``"pass"``.
Phase 1's exit-code-only rule remains a strict subset (``exit_code
== 0 and no detector fires`` -> pass), so any tooling that read the
Phase-1 minimum shape keeps working.

    The child is launched with ``start_new_session=True`` so it leads its own
    process group; signalling that group (``os.killpg``) rather than just
    ``proc.pid`` reaps grandchildren too -- e.g. a
    ``sudo -> bash -> docker run -> python3`` tree that would otherwise survive
    an interrupted or timed-out trial and keep its GPUs pinned (#220).

    Escalation: ``SIGTERM`` first (a foreground ``docker run`` forwards it to
    the container's PID 1, giving the container a chance to stop cleanly), then
    ``SIGKILL`` after ``grace_sec`` for anything that ignored it. Note that a
    *detached* ``docker run -d`` container is reparented to the docker daemon
    and is not in this group; tearing it down needs an explicit ``docker kill``
    in the workload wrapper.

    A race where the group already exited (``ESRCH`` /
    ``ProcessLookupError``) is the expected common case, not an error, and is
    swallowed silently. Any *other* signal-delivery failure (e.g. ``EPERM``)
    is logged at WARNING -- it means the group could not be torn down and the
    tree may leak, which the operator needs to see. As a safety net it refuses
    to signal the caller's own process group -- which can only happen if the
    child was not started in a new session -- so a misconfiguration can never
    take down the ``aorta`` process itself.

    The only exception it propagates is ``KeyboardInterrupt``: a second
    ``Ctrl-C`` landing while we wait out the grace period must not abandon the
    teardown mid-escalation and re-orphan the tree (#220). In that case we
    force ``SIGKILL`` on the group, reap best-effort, and *then* re-raise so

    Tier 1 alone is enough to give the trial a sensible verdict: it
    is the only tier that's a pure function of the subprocess exit
    state and the trial dir, so it can't itself crash on regex /
    capture / dmesg edge cases. We re-run :func:`tier1_detect`
    here (cheap, no FS work beyond a glob in ``trial_dir``) and
    encode the original classifier exception under
    ``capture['classifier_error']`` so operators see WHY the full
    classifier was bypassed instead of a silent Tier-1-only
    result. ``tier_durations_ms`` records the fallback in
    ``capture`` rather than the per-tier breakdown -- the other
    four tiers genuinely did not run.

    The operator's detector-disable knobs apply here too, so this
    fallback honours the same contract as :func:`classify_trial`: a
    silenced ``tier1`` / ``tier1:<id>`` doesn't fire. The caller passes
    the *effective* set (Tier 1 forced back on for an exec-failure trial)
    so a command-not-found still fails even with Tier 1 disabled.

    Verdict rule: the same fail > error > pass precedence the full
    resolver applies (issue #230) -- a Tier-1 ``tier1:timeout`` with
    no recognised hang or a ``tier1:exec_failed`` resolves to
    ``error``, a genuine Tier-1 signal to ``fail``, nothing to
    ``pass``. Matches the resolver so a classifier crash doesn't
    silently flip an infra error back into a fail.

    ``exec_failed`` (the workload's ``not launched`` flag) is
    forwarded into :class:`Tier1Context` so the fallback can still
    emit ``tier1:exec_failed`` (and suppress the misleading
    ``exit_nonzero`` from the synthetic 127/126/1 exit code) even
    when the full classifier is the thing that crashed.
